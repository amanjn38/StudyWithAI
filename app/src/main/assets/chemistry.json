Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure substances. Their utility or importance in life depends on their composition. For example, the properties of brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin); 1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water prevents tooth decay, while 1.5 ppm causes the tooth to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic concentrations that match with blood plasma concentrations and so on.<br><br>In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This will be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution.<br><br><strong><strong><strong><strong>Types of</strong></strong></strong> Solutions</strong><br>Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two components. By homogeneous mixture we mean that its composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent. Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or more components present in the solution other than solvent are called solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e., \"<br>        }<br>"

Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1.</p><p>Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to a lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution.</p><p>There are several ways by which we can describe the concentration of the solution quantitatively.</p><p>(i) Mass percentage (<em>w / w</em>): The mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as:</p><p> \\( \\text{Mass % of a component} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of the component in the solution}}{\\text{Total mass of the solution}} \\times 100 \\)</p><p>For example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by mass, it means that 10 g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water resulting in a 100 g solution.

Solutions containing liquids are commonly expressed in this unit. For example, a 35% (<em>v / v</em>) solution of ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the engine. At this concentration, the antifreeze lowers the freezing point of water to 255.4K (–17.6°C).</p><p>(iii) Mass by volume percentage (<em>w / V</em>): Another unit which is commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in 100 mL of the solution.</p><p>(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm) and is defined as:</p><p> \\( \\text{Parts per million} = \\frac{6 \\times \\text{Number of parts of the component}}{10 \\times \\text{Total number of parts of all components of the solution}} \\)</p><p>As in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume, and mass to volume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about 6 × 10<sup>–3</sup> g of dissolved oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). Such a small concentration is also expressed as 5.8 g per 10<sup>6</sup> g (5.8 ppm) of sea water. The concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed in terms of mg mL<sup>–1</sup> or ppm.</p><p>(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is <math>x</math> and subscript used on the right-hand side of <math>x</math> denotes the component.

While sodium chloride and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non-polar solutes in non-polar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say <em>like dissolves like</em>. When a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as <strong>dissolution</strong>. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as <strong>crystallisation</strong>. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, the number of solute particles going into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.</p><p><strong>Solute + Solvent ⇌ Solution</strong> (1.10)</p><p>At this stage, the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a <strong>saturated solution</strong>. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.</p><p>Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Effect of temperature</strong></p><p>The solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation (1.10). This, being dynamic equilibrium, must follow <em>Le Chatelier's Principle</em>. In general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is endothermic (<math>ΔH_{sol} > 0</math>), the solubility should increase with rise in temperature and if it is exothermic (<math>ΔH_{sol} < 0</math>), the solubility should decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.</p><p><strong>Effect of pressure</strong></p><p>Pressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure. Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water. Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and temperature.</p><p><strong>1.3.1 Solubility of a Solid in a Liquid</strong></p><p><strong>1.3.2 Solubility of a Gas in a Liquid</strong></p><p></p>"

For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous system at pressure <math>p</math> and temperature <math>T</math>. Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the solution and thus its solubility increases.</p><p><strong>Henry's Law</strong></p><p>Henry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as <strong>Henry’s law</strong>. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also concluded independently that the solubility of a gas in a liquid solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution.</p><p>The most commonly used form of Henry’s law states that “the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase (<math>p</math>) is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas (<math>x</math>) in the solution” and is expressed as: <math>p = K_H * x</math> Here <math>K_H</math> is the Henry’s law constant. If we draw a graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2. Different gases have different <math>K_H</math> values at the same temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that <math>K_H</math> is a function of the nature of the gas. It is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the value of <math>K_H</math> at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1.2 that <math>K_H</math> values for both N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> increase with increase of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.1:</strong> Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas.

                    "content": "<p>Chemistry According to Raoult’s law, the vapour pressure of a volatile component in a given solution is given by \\(p_i = x_i p_{i0}\\). In the solution of a gas in a liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and we have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry’s law which states that \\(p = K_H x\\). If we compare the equations for Raoult’s law and Henry’s law, it can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the proportionality constant \\(K_H\\) differs from \\(p_{10}\\). Thus, Raoult’s law becomes a special case of Henry’s law in which \\(K_H\\) becomes equal to \\(p_{10}\\). Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given temperature vapourise and under equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)]. In a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets reduced. Consequently, the number of solvent molecules escaping from the surface is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour pressure is also reduced. The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. Raoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let \\(p_1\\) be 1.4.2 Raoult’s Law as a special case of Henry’s Law 1.4.3 Vapour Pressure of Solutions of Solids in Liquids Fig. 1.4: Decrease in the vapour pressure of the solvent on account of the presence of solute in the solvent (a) evaporation of the molecules of the solvent from its surface is denoted by , (b) in a solution, solute particles have been denoted by and they also occupy part of the surface area. </p>"

A plot between the vapour pressure and the mole fraction of the solvent is linear (Fig. 1.5). Liquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal solutions on the basis of Raoult’s law. The solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of concentration are known as <strong>ideal solutions</strong>. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e., \\( \\Delta_{mix} H = 0, \\Delta_{mix} V = 0 \\) (1.21)<br/>It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category. When a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits <strong>positive deviation</strong> and if it is lower, it exhibits <strong>negative deviation</strong> from Raoult’s law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6. The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour<br/>Fig. 1.5 If a solution obeys Raoult's law for all concentrations, its vapour pressure would vary linearly from zero to the vapour pressure of the pure solvent.<br/>1.5 Ideal and Non-Ideal and Non-Ideal and Non-Ideal and Non-Ideal and Non-ideal Solutions ideal Solutions ideal Solutions ideal Solutions ideal Solutions 1.5.1 Ideal Solutions 1.5.2 Non-ideal Solutions "

In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation. In case of negative deviations from Raoult’s law, the intermolecular attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline. In this case, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult’s law <img src='https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\text{(Fig. 1.6 (b))}'/>.

We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the solute particles and it is independent of their identity.

From this equation (1.28), knowing all other quantities, the molar mass of solute (\\\\M_2\\\\) can be calculated. Example 1.6 The vapour pressure of pure benzene at a certain temperature is 0.850 bar. A non-volatile, non-electrolyte solid weighing 0.5 g when added to 39.0 g of benzene (molar mass 78 g mol<sup>-1</sup>). Vapour pressure of the solution, then, is 0.845 bar. What is the molar mass of the solid substance? The various quantities known to us are as follows: \\\\p_0\\\\ = 0.850 bar; \\\\p\\\\ = 0.845 bar; \\\\M_1\\\\ = 78 g mol<sup>-1</sup>; \\\\w_2\\\\ = 0.5 g; \\\\w_1\\\\ = 39 g Substituting these values in equation (1.28), we get:<br/><br/><math>0.850 - 0.845 = \\frac{{-1}}{{2}} \\times \\frac{{0.5 \\times 78}}{{39}} \\times M</math> Therefore, \\\\M_2\\\\ = 170 g mol<sup>-1</sup> The vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 373.15 K (100° C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence of non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is always higher than that of the boiling point of the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour pressure, the elevation of boiling point also depends on the number of solute molecules rather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of sucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373.52 K at one atmospheric pressure. Let \\\\T_0\\\\ be the boiling point of pure solvent and \\\\T\\\\ be the boiling point of solution. The increase in the boiling point \\\\Delta T_b\\\\ is known as elevation of boiling point.

For example, raw mangoes shrivel when pickled in brine (salt water); wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water, blood cells collapse when suspended in saline water, etc. If we look into these processes we find one thing common in all, that is, all these substances are bound by membranes. These membranes can be of animal or vegetable origin and these occur naturally such as pig’s bladder or parchment or can be synthetic such as cellophane. These membranes appear to be continuous sheets or films, yet they contain a network of submicroscopic holes or pores. Small solvent molecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind of properties are known as <em>semipermeable membranes</em> (SPM). Assume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semipermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow of the solvent is called <em>osmosis</em>. The flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called <em>osmotic pressure</em> of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution. The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration of the solution.<br/><br>The osmotic pressure of a solution is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the passage of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane into the solution. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property as it depends on the number of solute molecules and not on their identity.

When such solutions are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of 0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if we place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they would shrink.

When pressure more than osmotic pressure is applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea water through the membrane. A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose.

Cellulose acetate is permeable to water but impermeable to impurities and ions present in sea water.

This brings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into ions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than the true value. Molecules of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerise in benzene due to hydrogen bonding. This normally happens in solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case, the number of particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of molecules is depicted as follows: It can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic acid associate in benzene, then \\( D_{T_b} \\) or \\( D_{T_f} \\) for ethanoic acid will be half of the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this \\( D_{T_b} \\) or \\( D_{T_f} \\) will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called as abnormal molar mass. In 1880 van’t Hoff introduced a factor \\( i \\), known as the van’t Hoff factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This factor \\( i \\) is defined as: \\( i = \\frac{\\text{Normal molar mass}}{\\text{Abnormal molar mass}} \\). Observed colligative properties calculated colligative properties = Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation = \\( i \\). Here abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In case of association, value of \\( i \\) is less than unity while for dissociation it is greater than unity. For example, the value of \\( i \\) for aqueous KCl solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is nearly 0.5. Inclusion of van’t Hoff factor modifies the equations for colligative properties as follows: Relative lowering of vapour pressure of solvent, \\( \\Delta P = i \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\). Elevation of Boiling point, \\( \\Delta T_b = i K_b m \\). Depression of Freezing point, \\( \\Delta T_f = i K_f m \\). Osmotic pressure of solution, \\( P = i \\frac{nRT}{V} \\)."

In this device the  Gibbs energy  of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running  a  motor  or  other  electrical  gadgets    like  heater,  fan, geyser, etc. Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs. Zn(s) + Cu 2+ (aq)  ®  Zn 2+  (aq) + Cu(s) This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction: (i)   Cu 2+       +    2e –          ®   Cu(s)   (reduction half reaction)   (2.2) (ii)   Zn(s)     ®  Zn 2+   +  2e –   (oxidation half reaction)   (2.3) These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The  reduction  half  reaction  occurs  on  the  copper  electrode  while  the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of  the  cell  are  also  called   half-cells   or   redox  couples .  The  copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half- cell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1.  Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it  positively  charged.  At  the  same  time,  metal  atoms  of  the  electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons  at  the  electrode  trying  to  make  it  negatively  charged.  At equilibrium,  there  is  a  separation  of  charges  and  depending  on  the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with  respect to the solution. A potential difference develops  between  the  electrode  and  the  electrolyte  which  is  called  electrode potential . When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as  standard electrode  potential .  According  to  IUPAC  convention,  standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called  anode  and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called  cathode  and it has a positive  potential  with  respect  to  the  solution.  Thus,  there  exists  a potential  difference  between  the  two  electrodes  and  as  soon  as  the switch is in the  on  position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow.  2.2  Galvanic  Cells2.2  Galvanic  Cells2.2  Galvanic  Cells2.2  Galvanic  Cells2.2  Galvanic  Cells "

                    "content": "Chemistry  The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell  is  called  the   cell  potential   and  is  measured  in  volts.  The   cell potential  is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the  cell electromotive force (emf)   of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right  while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and  electrolyte  solution  and  putting  a  double  vertical  line  between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half- cell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e.,  E cell   =   E right     –   E left  This is illustrated by the following example: Cell reaction: Cu(s)  +  2Ag + (aq)   ¾®   Cu 2+ (aq)  +  2  Ag(s)   (2.4) Half-cell reactions: Cathode  ( reduction ):      2Ag + (aq)    +  2e –    ®   2Ag(s)   (2.5) Anode  ( oxidation ):        Cu(s)     ®   Cu 2+ (aq)  +  2e –   (2.6) It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: Cu(s)|Cu 2+ (aq)||Ag + (aq)|Ag(s) and  we  have   E cell   =   E right   –   E left   =   E Ag + ú Ag   –   E Cu 2+ ú Cu   (2.7) The  potential  of  individual  half-cell  cannot  be  measured.  We  can measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that  gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to  this.  According  to  convention,  a  half-cell called  standard  hydrogen  electrode  (Fig.3.3) represented by Pt(s) ú  H 2 (g) ú  H + (aq), is assigned a  zero  potential  at  all  temperatures corresponding to the reaction         H +   (aq)  +  e –      ®        1  2   H 2 (g) The standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black.  The  electrode  is  dipped  in  an  acidic solution  and  pure  hydrogen  gas  is  bubbled through  it.    The  concentration  of  both  the reduced  and  oxidised  forms  of  hydrogen  is maintained  at  unity  (Fig.  2.3).  This  implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the solution is one molar.  2.2.1 Measurement of Electrode Potential  Fig. 2.3:   Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE).

E o   =   E o R   –   E o L  As  E o L  for standard hydrogen electrode is zero.  E o   =   E o R   –  0  =   E o R  The measured emf of the cell: Pt(s)   Á  H 2 (g,  1  bar)   Á   H +   (aq,  1  M)   ÁÁ   Cu 2+   (aq,  1  M)    ̇   Cu is 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential of the half-cell corresponding to the reaction: Cu 2+   (aq,  1M)  +  2  e –      Æ     Cu(s) Similarly, the measured emf of the cell: Pt(s)   Á   H 2 (g,  1  bar)   Á  H +   (aq,  1  M)   ÁÁ   Zn 2+   (aq,  1M)   Á   Zn is -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the half-cell reaction: Zn 2+  (aq, 1 M) + 2e –   Æ   Zn(s) The positive  value of the standard electrode potential in the first case indicates that Cu 2+  ions get reduced more easily than H +  ions. The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu (or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under  the  standard  conditions  described  above.  Thus,  Cu  does  not dissolve in HCl.  In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion.  The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions). In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 2.1 can be written as: Left electrode: Zn(s)  Æ  Zn 2+  (aq, 1 M) + 2 e –  Right electrode: Cu 2+  (aq, 1 M) + 2 e –   Æ  Cu(s) The overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation: Zn(s)  +  Cu 2+   (aq)   Æ  Zn 2+   (aq)  +  Cu(s) emf of the cell =  E o cell   =   E o R   –   E o L  =  0.34V  –  (– 0.76)V  =  1.10  V Sometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes. They  do  not  participate  in  the  reaction  but  provide  their  surface  for oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons. For example, Pt is used in the following half-cells: Hydrogen electrode:  Pt(s)|H 2 (g)| H + (aq) With half-cell reaction:  H +   (aq)+ e –   Æ  ½ H 2 (g) Bromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br 2 (aq)| Br – (aq) "

The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F 2 ) has the maximum tendency  to  get  reduced  to  fluoride  ions  (F – )  and  therefore  fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen  that  as  we  go  from  top  to  bottom  in  Table  2.1  the  standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the  species  on  the  right  hand  side  of  the  reaction.

At the same time voltage of the cell as read on the voltmeter keeps on decreasing. After some time, we shall note that there is no change in  the  concentration  of  Cu 2+   and  Zn 2+   ions  and  at  the  same  time, voltmeter gives zero reading.

The  electrical resistance is represented by the symbol  ‘R’  and it is measured in ohm ( W ) which  in  terms  of  SI  base  units  is  equal  to  (kg  m 2 )/( S 3    A 2 ).  It  can  be measured  with  the  help  of  a   Wheatstone  bridge   with  which  you  are familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object is directly proportional to its length,  l , and inversely proportional to its area of cross section,  A . That is,  R    μ    l  A     or   R   =   r    l  A   (2.17) The constant of proportionality,  r  (Greek, rho), is called  resistivity  (specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre ( W  m) and quite often its submultiple, ohm centimetre ( W  cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area of cross section is one m 2 . It can be seen that: 1   W   m  =  100   W   cm  or  1   W   cm  =  0.01   W   m The inverse of resistance,  R , is called  conductance ,   G , and we have the relation:  G   =     1  R   =     ρ     A   A  l   l   (2.18) The SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol ‘S’ and is equal to ohm –1  (also known as mho) or  W –1 .

IUPAC has recommended the use of term conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are S  m –1   but  quite  often,   k   is  expressed  in  S  cm –1 .  Conductivity  of  a material in S m –1  is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area of cross section is 1 m 2 .

                    "content": "Chemistry  *   Electronically conducting polymers – In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be polymerised  to  produce  a  polymer,  polyacetylene  when  exposed  to  vapours  of  iodine  acquires  metallic  lustre  and conductivity.  Since  then  several  organic  conducting  polymers  have  been  made  such  as  polyaniline,  polypyrrole  and polythiophene.  These  organic  polymers  which  have  properties  like  metals,  being  composed  wholly  of  elements  like carbon,  hydrogen  and  occasionally  nitrogen,  oxygen  or  sulphur,  are  much  lighter  than  normal  metals  and  can  be  used for  making  light-weight  batteries.  Besides,  they  have  the  mechanical  properties  of  polymers  such  as  flexibility  so  that one can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting polymers,  MacDiarmid,  Heeger  and  Shirakawa  were  awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  in  Chemistry  for  the  year  2000.  It  can  be  seen  from  Table  2.2  that  the  magnitude  of  conductivity varies  a  great  deal  and  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  material.  It  also depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements are  made.  Materials  are  classified  into  conductors,  insulators  and semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors. Certain  non-metals  like  carbon-black,  graphite  and  some  organic polymers *   are  also  electronically  conducting.  Substances  like  glass, ceramics,  etc.,  having  very  low  conductivity  are  known  as  insulators. Substances  like  silicon,  doped  silicon  and  gallium  arsenide  having conductivity  between  conductors  and  insulators  are  called semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials called  superconductors  by  definition  have  zero  resistivity  or  infinite conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures (0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.  Electrical conductance  through metals is called metallic or electronic conductance  and  is  due  to  the  movement  of  electrons.  The  electronic conductance depends on (i)   the nature and structure of the metal (ii)   the number of valence electrons per atom (iii)   temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).

The mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex. We already know that even very pure water has small amounts of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10 –7 M) which lend it very low conductivity (3.5  ×  10 –5  S m –1 ). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The conductance  of  electricity  by  ions  present  in  the  solutions  is  called electrolytic or  ionic conductance . The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic) solutions depends on: (i)   the nature of the electrolyte added (ii)   size of the ions produced and their solvation (iii)   the nature of the solvent and its viscosity (iv)   concentration of the electrolyte (v)   temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature). Passage  of  direct  current  through  ionic  solution  over  a  prolonged period  can  lead  to  change  in  its  composition  due  to  electrochemical reactions (Section 2.4.1). We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution  cannot be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor. The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source of  power.  The  second  problem  is  solved  by  using  a  specially  designed vessel called  conductivity cell.  It is available in several   designs and two simple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4.  2.4.1   Measurement of the Conductivity of Ionic Solutions  Connecting wires Platinized Pt electrodes Platinized Pt electrodePlatinized Pt electrode Connecting wires  Fig. 2.4  Two  different  types  of conductivity  cells.  Basically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum black  (finely  divided  metallic  Pt  is  deposited  on  the  electrodes electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to ‘ A ’ and are separated  by  distance  ‘ l ’.  Therefore,  solution  confined  between  these electrodes  is  a  column  of  length   l   and  area  of  cross  section   A .  The resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation:  R   =   r    l  A   =       l  A   (2.17) "

For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3) and at different temperatures. The cell constant,  G *, is then given by the equation:  G * =  l  A     = R  k   (2.18) Once  the  cell  constant  is  determined,  we  can use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity of any solution.  The set up for the measurement of the resistance is shown in Fig. 2.5. It  consists  of  two  resistances   R 3   and   R 4 ,  a variable  resistance   R 1   and  the  conductivity  cell having  the  unknown  resistance   R 2 .  The  Wheatstone  bridge   is  fed  by  an  oscillator  O  (a source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range 550  to  5000  cycles  per  second).  P  is  a  suitable detector  (a  headphone  or  other  electronic  device) and the bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector. Under these conditions: Unknown resistance  R 2  =  1   4  3 R    R R   (2.19) These days, inexpensive conductivity meters are available which can directly read the conductance or resistance of the solution in the conductivity cell. Once the cell constant and the resistance of the solution in the cell is determined, the conductivity of the solution is given by the equation:  cell constant   G*  R   R          (2.20) The  conductivity  of  solutions  of  different  electrolytes  in  the  same solvent and at a given temperature differs due to charge and size of the  Fig. 2.5:  Arrangement for measurement of resistance  of  a  solution  of  an electrolyte.

This  is because the total volume,  V , of solution containing  one  mole  of  electrolyte  also increases. It has been found that decrease in   k   on  dilution  of  a  solution  is  more than  compensated  by  increase  in  its volume.

He noted that the difference in  L ° m    of the electrolytes NaX and KX for any X is nearly constant. For example at  298  K:  L ° m    (KCl)   –    L ° m    (NaCl)   =    L ° m    (KBr)   –    L ° m    (NaBr)  =    L ° m    (KI)   –    L ° m    (NaI)   ≃   23.4  S  cm 2   mol –1  and similarly it was found that  L ° m    (NaBr) –    L ° m    (NaCl)   =    L ° m    (KBr)   –    L ° m    (KCl)    ≃    1.8  S  cm 2   mol –1  On the basis of the above observations he enunciated  Kohlrausch law  of  independent  migration  of  ions .  The  law  states  that   limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the individual  contributions  of  the  anion  and  cation  of  the  electrolyte .  Thus,  if  l ° Na +   and  l ° Cl –  are limiting molar  conductivity  of the sodium and chloride ions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride is given by the equation:  L ° m    (NaCl)   =   l ° Na+   +   l ° Cl–   (2.24) In general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives  n +   cations and  n –  anions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by:  L ° m      =   n +   l ° +   +   n –    l ° –   (2.25) Here,  l ° +  and  l ° –  are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation and anion respectively.

Table 2.4:   Limiting Molar Conductivity for some Ions in Water at 298 K  Weak  Electrolytes  Weak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in  L m  with  dilution  is  due  to  increase  in  the  degree  of  dissociation  and consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains  1  mol  of  electrolyte.  In  such  cases   L m   increases  steeply  (Fig.  2.6)  on dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore,  L ° m    cannot be obtained by extrapolation of  L m  to zero concentration. At infinite dilution (i.e., concentration  c   ®  zero) electrolyte dissociates completely ( a  =1), but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low that it cannot be measured accurately.

The electrochemical processes are of great importance in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic cell  consists  of  two  copper  strips  dipping  in  an  aqueous  solution  of copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then Cu  2+  ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the following reaction takes place: Cu 2+ (aq)  +  2e –   ®   Cu  (s)   (2.28) Copper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is converted into Cu 2+  ions by the reaction: Cu(s)  ®  Cu 2+ (s) + 2e –   (2.29) Thus  copper  is  dissolved  (oxidised)  at  anode  and  deposited (reduced)  at  cathode.  This  is  the  basis  for  an  industrial  process  in which  impure  copper  is  converted  into  copper  of  high  purity.

(ii)   Second Law : The amounts of different substances liberated by the same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass of Metal ÷ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation).  2 . 52 . 5  2 . 52 . 5 2 . 5  ElectrolyticElectrolytic ElectrolyticElectrolyticElectrolytic Cells  andCells  andCells  andCells  andCells  and ElectrolysisElectrolysis ElectrolysisElectrolysisElectrolysis  Intext  QuestionsIntext  QuestionsIntext  QuestionsIntext  QuestionsIntext  Questions  2.7   Why does the conductivity of a solution decrease with dilution?  2.8    Suggest a way to determine the  L ° m   value  of  water.  2.9  The molar conductivity of 0.025 mol L –1  methanoic acid is 46.1 S cm 2  mol –1 .

The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic cell) for determining the quantity of electricity  passed from the amount of  metal  (generally  silver  or  copper)  deposited  or  consumed.  However, coulometers  are  now  obsolete  and  we  now  have  constant  current  ( I ) sources available and the quantity of electricity  Q , passed is given by  Q  =  It Q  is in coloumbs when  I  is in ampere and  t  is in second.

For  approximate  calculations  we  use  1F   ≃   96500  C  mol –1 . For the electrode reactions: Mg 2+ (l)  +  2e –    ¾®   Mg(s)   (2.31) Al 3+ (l)  +  3e –    ¾®   Al(s)   (2.32) It is obvious that one mole of Mg 2+  and Al 3+  require 2 mol of electrons (2F) and 3 mol of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals, current  as  high  as  50,000  amperes  are  used  that  amounts  to  about 0.518  F  per  second. A solution of CuSO 4  is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of 1.5 amperes. What is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode?  t   =  600  s    charge  =  current   ×   time  =  1.5  A   ×   600  s  =  900  C According to the reaction: Cu 2+ (aq) + 2e –  = Cu(s) We  require  2F  or  2   ×   96487  C  to  deposit  1  mol  or  63  g  of  Cu. For 900 C, the mass of Cu deposited =  (63  g  mol –1   ×   900  C)/(2   ×   96487  C  mol –1 )  =  0.2938  g.

If  the  electrode  is inert  (e.g.,  platinum  or  gold),  it  does  not  participate  in  the  chemical reaction  and  acts  only  as  source  or  sink  for  electrons.  On  the  other hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction. Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert  2.5.1 Products  of Electrolysis "

Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do not seem to take place and extra potential (called  overpotential ) has to be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur. For example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are sodium metal and Cl 2  gas. Here we have only one cation (Na + ) which is reduced  at  the  cathode  (Na +   +  e –    Æ   Na)  and  one  anion  (Cl – )  which is oxidised at the anode (Cl –  Æ  ½Cl 2  + e –  ) . During the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl 2  and H 2 . In this case besides Na +  and Cl –  ions we also have H +  and OH –  ions along with the solvent molecules, H 2 O. At the cathode there is competition between the following reduction reactions: Na +  (aq) + e –   Æ  Na (s)     o  cell E     =  –  2.71  V H +   (aq)  +  e –    Æ   ½  H 2   (g)     o  cell E     =  0.00  V The reaction with higher value of  E  o  is preferred and therefore, the reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is: H +   (aq)  +  e –    Æ   ½  H 2   (g)   (2.33) but H +  (aq) is produced by the dissociation of H 2 O, i.e., H 2 O ( l  )  Æ  H +  (aq) + OH –  (aq)   (2.34) Therefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum of (2.33) and (2.34) and we have H 2 O  ( l  )  +  e –    Æ   ½H 2 (g)  +  OH –   (2.35) At the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible: Cl –  (aq)  Æ  ½ Cl 2  (g) + e –    o  cell E     =  1.36 V   (2.36) 2H 2 O ( l  )   Æ   O 2   (g)  +  4H + (aq)  +  4e –    o  cell E      =  1.23  V   (2.37) The  reaction  at  anode  with  lower  value  of   E   o    is  preferred  and therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to Cl –  (aq). However, on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus, the net reactions may be summarised as: NaCl (aq)  H   O 2   Na +  (aq) + Cl –  (aq) Cathode:   H 2 O( l  )  +  e –    Æ   ½  H 2 (g)  +  OH –   (aq) Anode:   Cl –   (aq)   Æ   ½  Cl 2 (g)  +  e –  Net reaction: NaCl(aq) + H 2 O( l  )  Æ  Na + (aq) + OH – (aq) + ½H 2 (g) + ½Cl 2 (g) The standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials given by Nernst equation (Eq. 2.8) to take into account the concentration effects. During the electrolysis of sulphuric acid, the following processes are possible at the anode: 2H 2 O(l )   Æ   O 2 (g)  +  4H + (aq)  +  4e –              o  cell E   =  +1.23  V   (2.38) "

Any battery (actually it may have one or more than one cell connected in series) or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically a  galvanic  cell  where  the  chemical  energy  of  the  redox  reaction  is converted into electrical energy. However, for a battery to be of practical use it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries. In the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use over  a  period  of  time  battery  becomes  dead  and  cannot  be  reused again. The most familiar example of this type is the dry cell (known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is used  commonly  in  our  transistors  and  clocks.  The  cell consists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and the  cathode  is  a  carbon  (graphite)  rod  surrounded  by powdered  manganese  dioxide  and  carbon  (Fig.2.8).  The space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) and zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ).

Ammonia produced in the reaction forms a complex with Zn 2+  to give [Zn (NH 3 ) 4 ] 2+ . The cell has a potential of nearly 1.5 V. Mercury cell, (Fig. 2.9) suitable for low current devices like hearing aids, watches, etc. consists of zinc – mercury amalgam as anode and a paste of HgO and carbon as the cathode.

A  secondary  cell  after  use  can  be  recharged  by  passing  current through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again.

The  overall  reaction  during discharge is: Cd (s) + 2Ni(OH) 3  (s)  ®  CdO (s) + 2Ni(OH) 2  (s) + H 2 O (l ) Production of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy (heat  of  combustion)  of  fossil  fuels  (coal,  gas  or  oil)  is  first  used  for converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously to  the  electrodes  and  products  are  removed  continuously  from  the electrolyte compartment.  Galvanic cells  that are designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol, etc. directly into electrical energy are called  fuel cells . One of the most successful fuel cells uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to  form  water  (Fig.  2.12).  The  cell  was used for providing electrical power in the Apollo  space  programme.  The  water vapours  produced  during  the  reaction were  condensed  and  added  to  the drinking water supply for the astronauts. In  the  cell,  hydrogen  and  oxygen  are bubbled  through  porous  carbon electrodes  into  concentrated  aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.

There  has  been tremendous  progress  in  the  development  of  new  electrode  materials, better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells. These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis. Fuel cells are pollution free and in view of their future importance, a variety of fuel cells have been fabricated and tried. Corrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or other  salts  of  the  metal.  The  rusting  of  iron,  tarnishing  of  silver, development  of  green  coating  on  copper  and  bronze  are  some  of  the examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to buildings,  bridges,  ships  and  to  all  objects  made  of metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees every year on account of corrosion. In corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons to  oxygen  and  formation  of  oxides.  Corrosion  of  iron (commonly  known  as  rusting)  occurs  in  presence  of water  and  air.  The  chemistry  of  corrosion  is  quite complex  but  it  may  be  considered essentially  as  an  electrochemical phenomenon.  At  a  particular  spot (Fig. 2.13) of an object made of iron, oxidation  takes  place  and  that  spot behaves  as  anode  and  we  can  write the reaction Anode:  2  Fe  (s)   æÆ   2  Fe 2+   +  4  e –   o  2+ (Fe   /Fe) E     =  –  0.44  V Electrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of H +  (which is believed to be available from H 2 CO 3  formed due to dissolution of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also be  available  due  to  dissolution  of  other  acidic  oxides  from  the atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction Cathode: O 2 (g) + 4 H + (aq) + 4 e –   æÆ  2 H 2 O (l )  o   +   2   2 H   O   H  O   = 1.23 V E The overall reaction being: 2Fe(s) + O 2 (g) + 4H + (aq)  æÆ  2Fe 2 + (aq) + 2 H 2 O (l)     o  (cell) E   =1.67 V The  ferrous  ions  are  further  oxidised  by  atmospheric  oxygen  to ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3 .  x  H 2 O) and with further production of hydrogen ions. Prevention  of  corrosion  is  of  prime  importance.  It  not  only  saves money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse or  failure  of  a  key  component  due  to  corrosion.  One  of  the  simplest methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which corrodes itself but saves the object.  2.82.8 2.82.82.8   CorrosionCorrosionCorrosionCorrosionCorrosion "

As  more  people  on  the  planet  aspire  to  improve  their standard  of  living,  their  energy  requirement  will  increase.  In  fact,  the  per capita  consumption  of  energy  used  is  a  measure  of  development.  Of  course,  it is  assumed  that  energy  is  used  for  productive  purpose  and  not  merely  wasted. We  are  already  aware  that  carbon  dioxide  produced  by  the  combustion  of  fossil fuels  is  resulting  in  the  ‘Greenhouse  Effect’.  This  is  leading  to  a  rise  in  the temperature  of  the  Earth’s  surface,  causing  polar  ice  to  melt  and  ocean  levels to  rise.

SummarySummary SummarySummarySummary  An   electrochemical  cell   consists  of  two  metallic  electrodes  dipping  in  electrolytic solution(s).  Thus  an  important  component  of  the  electrochemical  cell  is  the  ionic conductor  or  electrolyte.  Electrochemical  cells  are  of  two  types.  In   galvanic  cell , the   chemical    energy   of  a   spontaneous  redox  reaction   is  converted  into  electrical work,  whereas  in  an  electrolytic  cell,  electrical  energy  is  used  to  carry  out  a   non- spontaneous  redox  reaction .  The   standard  electrode  potential   for  any  electrode dipping  in  an  appropriate  solution  is  defined  with  respect  to  standard  electrode potential  of   hydrogen  electrode   taken  as  zero.  The  standard  potential  of  the  cell can  be  obtained  by  taking  the  difference  of  the  standard  potentials  of  cathode  and anode  (     o  cell E     =   E o cathode  –   E o anode).  The  standard  potential  of  the  cells  are related  to  standard  Gibbs  energy  ( D rG o   =  – nF     o  cell E   )  and   equilibrium  constant  ( D rG o  =  – RT  ln  K ) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence of  the  potentials  of  the    electrodes  and  the  cells  are  given  by  Nernst  equation. The   conductivity ,   k ,  of  an  electrolytic  solution  depends  on  the  concentration of  the  electrolyte,  nature  of  solvent  and  temperature.   Molar  conductivity ,   L m ,  is defined  by  =   k / c   where   c   is  the  concentration.  Conductivity  decreases  but  molar conductivity  increases  with  decrease  in  concentration.  It  increases  slowly  with decrease  in  concentration  for  strong  electrolytes  while  the  increase  is  very  steep for  weak  electrolytes  in  very  dilute  solutions.

Substances with well defined properties are converted by  chemical  reactions  into  other  substances  with different properties. For any chemical reaction, chemists try  to  find  out (a)   the feasibility of a chemical reaction which can be predicted by thermodynamics ( as you know that a reaction with  D G < 0, at constant temperature and pressure is feasible); (b)   extent  to  which  a  reaction  will  proceed  can  be determined from chemical equilibrium; (c)   speed of a reaction i.e. time taken by a reaction to reach equilibrium. Along  with  feasibility  and  extent,  it  is  equally important to know the rate and the factors controlling the  rate  of  a  chemical  reaction  for  its  complete understanding.  For  example,  which  parameters determine  as  to  how  rapidly  food  gets  spoiled?  How to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling? Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an auto engine? All these questions can be answered by the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of  reaction  rates  and  their  mechanisms,  called  chemical kinetics . The word kinetics is derived from the  Greek  word  ‘kinesis’  meaning  movement. Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate of  a  reaction.    For  example,  thermodynamic  data indicate  that  diamond  shall  convert  to  graphite  but in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change is not perceptible at all.

Kinetic studies not only help us to determine the  speed  or  rate  of  a  chemical  reaction  but  also  describe  the conditions  by  which  the  reaction  rates  can  be  altered.  The  factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate  of  a  reaction.  At  the  macroscopic  level,  we  are  interested  in amounts  reacted  or  formed  and  the  rates  of  their  consumption  or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving orientation  and  energy  of  molecules  undergoing  collisions, are discussed. In this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous rate  of  reaction  and  the  factors  affecting  these.  Some  elementary ideas  about  the  collision  theory  of  reaction  rates  are  also  given. However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the reaction rate. Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate speed.  Can  you  think  of  more  examples  from  each  category? You must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain period  of  time.  Similarly,  the  speed  of    a  reaction  or    the  rate  of  a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of  a reactant or  product  in  unit  time.  To  be  more  specific,  it  can  be  expressed  in terms of: (i)   the  rate  of  decrease  in  concentration  of  any  one  of  the reactants, or (ii)   the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products. Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the system remains constant. R   Æ   P One mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If [R] 1   and [P] 1  are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time t 1  and [R] 2  and [P] 2  are their concentrations at time  t 2  then,  D t   =   t 2   –   t 1  D [R]   =   [R] 2   –  [R] 1  D   [P]   =   [P] 2   –  [P] 1  The square brackets in the above expressions are used to express molar concentration.

However, average rate cannot be used to predict the rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular moment of time we determine the  instantaneous rate .

The equation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus,  rate law is the expression  in  which  reaction  rate  is  given  in  terms  of  molar concentration  of  reactants  with  each  term  raised  to  some power,  which  may  or  may  not  be  same  as  the  stoichiometric coefficient  of  the  reacting  species  in  a  balanced  chemical equation .  For  example: 2NO(g)  +  O 2 (g)   ®   2NO 2   (g) We  can  measure  the  rate  of  this  reaction  as  a  function  of  initial concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants constant  and  changing  the  concentration  of  the  other  reactant  or  by changing the concentration of both the reactants.

This indicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of NO.  When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of O 2  is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends on concentration of O 2  to the first power.  Hence, the rate equation for this reaction will be Rate =  k  [NO] 2 [O 2 ] "

The  number  of  reacting  species (atoms,  ions  or  molecules)  taking  part  in  an  elementary reaction,  which  must  collide  simultaneously  in  order  to  bring about  a  chemical  reaction  is  called    molecularity    of  a  reaction . The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved, for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite. "

Hence,  reactions  with  the molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed. It is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more than one step. KClO 3   +  6FeSO 4   +  3H 2 SO 4    ®   KCl  +  3Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3   +  3H 2 O This reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction, for  example,  chances  to  win  the  relay  race  competition  by  a  team depend upon the slowest person in the team.  Similarly, the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the  rate  determining  step .  Consider  the  decomposition  of  hydrogen peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium. 2H 2 O 2   - I Alkaline medium     2H 2 O + O 2  The rate equation for this reaction is found to be                2   2 2   2  d   H   ORate   H   O   I d         kt This reaction is first order with respect to both H 2 O 2  and I – .    Evidences suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps (1)  H 2 O 2   +    I –   ®   H 2 O    +    IO –  (2)  H 2 O 2   +    IO –    ®   H 2 O    +    I –   +    O 2  Both the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO -  is called  as  an  intermediate  since  it  is  formed  during  the  course  of  the reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being slow,  is  the  rate  determining  step.    Thus,  the  rate  of  formation  of intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction. Thus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following: (i)   Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer. (ii)   Order  is  applicable  to  elementary  as  well  as  complex  reactions whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions. For complex reaction molecularity has no meaning. "

What is the order of the reaction?  3.4   The  conversion  of  molecules  X  to  Y  follows  second  order  kinetics.  If concentration of X is increased to three times how will it affect the rate of formation of Y ? We have already noted that the concentration dependence of rate is called  differential  rate  equation.  It  is  not  always  convenient  to determine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination of  slope  of  the  tangent  at  point  ‘ t ’  in  concentration  vs  time  plot (Fig. 3.1).  This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence the  order  of  the  reaction.  In  order  to  avoid  this  difficulty,  we  can integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly measured  experimental  data,  i.e.,  concentrations  at  different  times and rate constant. The integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different reaction orders.  We shall determine these equations only for zero and first order chemical reactions. Zero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional to zero power of the concentration of reactants. Consider the reaction, R   ®   P Rate   =            0 d   R   R d   kt     As    any  quantity  raised  to  power  zero  is  unity Rate   =      d   R   1 d   k   × t     d[R]   =  –   k   d t  Integrating both sides [R]   =  –   k  t   +  I   (3.5) where, I is the constant of integration. At   t  = 0, the concentration of the reactant R = [R] 0 , where [R] 0  is initial concentration of the reactant. Substituting in equation (3.5) [R] 0   =  – k    ×   0  +  I [R] 0   = I Substituting the value of I in the equation (3.5) [R]   =  - kt   +  [R] 0   (3.6)  3 . 33 . 3  3 . 33 . 3 3 . 3  IntegratedIntegrated IntegratedIntegratedIntegrated RateRateRateRateRate EquationsEquations EquationsEquationsEquations  3.3.1 Zero  Order Reactions "

Further simplifying equation (3.6), we get the rate constant,  k  as      0 R   R k   t    (3.7) Zero order reactions are relatively uncommon but they occur under special conditions. Some enzyme catalysed  reactions  and  reactions  which  occur  on metal  surfaces  are  a  few  examples  of  zero  order reactions.  The decomposition of gaseous ammonia on a hot platinum surface is a zero order reaction at high pressure.        1130K 3   2   2Pt   catalyst 2NH   g   N   g   +3H   g  Rate =  k  [NH 3 ] 0  =  k  In this reaction, platinum metal acts as a catalyst. At high pressure, the  metal  surface  gets  saturated  with  gas  molecules.  So,  a  further change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface is another example of zero order reaction. In this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the first power of the concentration of the reactant R. For example, R   ®   P     d   RRate   R d   kt  or          d   R   –   d R   k   t  Integrating this equation, we get ln [R] = –  kt  + I   (3.8) Again, I  is the constant of integration and its value can be determined easily. When   t  = 0, R = [R] 0 , where [R] 0  is the initial concentration of the reactant. Therefore, equation (3.8) can be written as ln [R] 0  = – k   ×  0 + I ln [R] 0   =    I Substituting the value of I in equation (3.8) ln[R] = – k t  + ln[R] 0   (3.9)  3.3.2   First  Order Reactions "

For example, in decomposition of N 2 O 5 , the time taken for half of the original  amount  of  material  to  decompose  is  12  min  at  50 o C,  5  h  at 25 o C and 10 days at 0 o C.

In reality, it is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and water affect the rate of the reaction. But water is taken in large excess for  hydrolysis,  therefore,  concentration  of  water  is  not  altered  much during  the  reaction.  Thus,  the  rate  of  reaction  is  affected  by concentration of ethyl acetate only. For example, during the hydrolysis of 0.01 mol of ethyl acetate with 10 mol of water, amounts of the reactants and products at the beginning ( t  = 0) and completion ( t ) of the reaction are given as under.

Fig. 3.7   is obtained by plotting potential energy vs reaction coordinate. Reaction coordinate represents the profile of energy change  when  reactants  change  into products. Some  energy  is  released  when  the complex decomposes to form products. So,  the  final  enthalpy  of  the  reaction  depends  upon  the  nature  of  reactants and products. All  the  molecules  in  the  reacting species  do  not  have  the  same  kinetic energy.  Since it is difficult to predict the behaviour  of  any  one  molecule  with precision, Ludwig Boltzmann and James Clark Maxwell used statistics to predict the  behaviour  of  large  number  of molecules.  According    to  them,  the distribution  of  kinetic  energy  may  be described  by  plotting  the  fraction  of molecules  ( N E / N T )  with  a  given  kinetic energy  (E)  vs  kinetic  energy  (Fig.  3.8). Here,  N E  is the number of molecules with energy   E   and   N T   is  total  number of molecules. The peak of the curve corresponds to the  most   probable kinetic energy,  i.e., kinetic  energy  of  maximum  fraction  of molecules.

The  area  under  the  curve must  be  constant  since  total probability must be one at all times. We  can  mark  the  position  of     E a   on Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve (Fig. 3.9).   Increasing the temperature of the substance increases the fraction of  molecules,  which  collide  with  energies  greater  than   E a .  It  is  clear from the diagram that in the curve at ( t   + 10), the area showing the fraction of molecules having energy equal to or greater than activation energy gets doubled leading to doubling the rate of a reaction. In the Arrhenius equation (3.18) the factor e  - E a / RT    corresponds to the  fraction  of  molecules  that  have  kinetic  energy  greater  than   E a . Taking natural logarithm of both sides of equation (3.18) ln  k   =  –   a E  RT     +  ln   A   (3.19) The plot of ln  k  vs 1/T gives a straight line according to the equation (3.19) as shown in Fig. 3.10. Thus,  it  has  been  found  from  Arrhenius  equation  (3.18)  that increasing  the  temperature  or  decreasing  the  activation  energy  will result  in  an  increase  in  the  rate  of  the  reaction  and  an  exponential increase in the rate constant.

For example, MnO 2  catalyses the following reaction so as to increase its rate considerably. 2KClO 3    MnO2      2  KCl  +  3O 2  The word catalyst should not be used when the added substance reduces the rate of raction. The substance is then called inhibitor. The action of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory. According to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by forming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate complex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products and the catalyst. It is believed that the catalyst provides an alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by reducing  the  activation  energy  between reactants and products and hence lowering the  potential  energy  barrier  as  shown  in Fig.  3.11. It  is  clear  from  Arrhenius  equation  (3.18) that lower the value of activation energy faster will be the rate of a reaction. A small amount of the catalyst can catalyse a  large  amount  of  reactants.  A  catalyst  does not  alter   Gibbs  energy ,   D G  of  a  reaction.    It catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does not catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier. Though  Arrhenius  equation  is  applicable  under  a  wide  range  of circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max  Trautz and  William  Lewis  in  1916  -18,  provides  a  greater  insight  into  the energetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions.

The  number  of  collisions  per second  per  unit  volume  of  the  reaction  mixture  is  known  as collision  frequency  (Z) .    Another  factor  which  affects  the  rate  of chemical  reactions  is  activation  energy  (as  we  have  already  studied). For a bimolecular elementary reaction A  +  B       ®       Products rate of reaction can be expressed as  a   / AB Rate   Z   e   E   RT   (3.23) where  Z AB  represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B and e - E a / RT  represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to or greater than  E a . Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can say that  A  is related to collision frequency. Equation  (3.23)  predicts  the  value  of  rate  constants  fairly accurately  for  the  reactions  that  involve  atomic  species  or  simple molecules  but  for  complex  molecules  significant  deviations  are observed.  The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with sufficient  kinetic  energy  (called  threshold  energy*)  and  proper orientation,  so  as  to  facilitate  breaking  of  bonds  between  reacting species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as  effective  collisions.  For  example,  formation  of methanol from bromoethane depends upon  the  orientation  of  reactant molecules  as  shown  in Fig.  3.12.   The  proper  orientation  of reactant  molecules  lead  to  bond formation  whereas  improper orientation  makes  them  simply bounce  back  and  no  products  are formed.  To account for effective collisions, another factor  P , called the probability or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e.,  a   / AB Rate   Z   e   E   RT P     Thus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision and hence the rate of a chemical reaction. Collision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/ molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect.

SummarySummary SummarySummarySummary  Chemical  kinetics   is  the  study  of  chemical  reactions  with  respect  to  reaction rates,  effect  of  various  variables,  rearrangement  of  atoms  and  formation  of intermediates.    The  rate  of  a  reaction  is  concerned  with  decrease  in  concentration of  reactants  or  increase  in  the  concentration  of  products  per  unit  time.    It  can be  expressed  as  instantaneous  rate  at  a  particular  instant  of  time  and  average rate  over  a  large  interval  of  time.    A  number  of  factors  such  as  temperature, concentration  of  reactants,  catalyst,  affect  the  rate  of  a  reaction.    Mathematical representation  of  rate  of  a  reaction  is  given  by   rate  law .    It  has  to  be  determined experimentally  and  cannot  be  predicted.     Order  of  a  reaction   with  respect  to a  reactant  is  the  power  of  its  concentration    which  appears  in  the  rate  law equation.  The  order  of  a  reaction  is  the  sum  of  all  such  powers  of  concentration of  terms  for  different  reactants.   Rate  constant   is  the  proportionality  factor  in the  rate  law.    Rate  constant  and  order  of  a  reaction  can  be  determined  from  rate law  or  its  integrated  rate  equation.     Molecularity  is  defined  only  for  an  elementary reaction.    Its  values  are  limited  from  1  to  3  whereas  order  can  be  0,  1,  2,  3  or even  a  fraction.  Molecularity  and  order  of  an  elementary  reaction  are  same. Temperature  dependence  of  rate  constants  is  described  by  Arrhenius  equation ( k   =   A e – E a/ RT ).   E a   corresponds  to  the   activation  energy   and  is  given  by  the energy  difference  between  activated  complex  and  the  reactant  molecules,  and   A  (Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor)  corresponds to  the collision frequency. The  equation  clearly  shows  that  increase  of  temperature  or  lowering  of  E a   will lead  to  an  increase  in  the  rate  of  reaction  and  presence  of  a  catalyst  lowers  the activation  energy  by  providing  an  alternate  path  for  the  reaction.  According  to collision  theory,  another  factor   P   called  steric  factor  which  refers  to  the  orientation of  molecules  which  collide,  is  important  and  contributes  to  effective  collisions, thus,  modifying  the  Arrhenius  equation  to   a   / AB Z   e   E   RT k   P       .

The names   transition  metals   and   inner  transition   metals are  often  used  to  refer  to  the  elements  of   d -and  f -blocks respectively.

However, the  usual  theory  of  valence  as  applicable  to  the  non- transition  elements  can  be  applied  successfully  to  the transition elements also. Various  precious  metals  such  as  silver,  gold  and platinum  and  industrially  important  metals  like  iron, copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series. In  this  Unit,  we  shall  first  deal  with  the  electronic configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of transition elements with special emphasis on the trends in  the  properties  of  the  first  row  (3 d )  transition  metals along  with  the  preparation  and  properties  of  some important  compounds.  This  will  be  followed  by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals.  THE  TRANSITION  ELEMENTS  ( d -BLOCK)  The   d –block  occupies  the  large  middle  section  of  the  periodic  table flanked between  s – and  p – blocks in the periodic table. The  d –orbitals of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to four  rows  of  the  transition  metals,  i.e.,  3 d ,  4 d ,  5 d   and  6 d .  All  these series of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1. In general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements is (n-1) d 1– 10 n s 1–2 except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4 d 10 5 s 0 . The (n–1) stands for the inner  d  orbitals which may have one to ten electrons and the outermost n s  orbital may have one or two electrons. However,  this  generalisation  has  several  exceptions  because  of  very little  energy  difference  between  (n-1) d   and  n s   orbitals.  Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the 3 d  series. For example, consider the case of Cr, which  has  3 d 5   4 s 1   configuration  instead  of  3 d 4 4 s 2 ;  the  energy  gap between the two sets (3 d  and 4 s ) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron  entering  the  3 d   orbitals.  Similarly  in  case  of  Cu,  the configuration  is  3 d 10 4 s 1   and  not  3 d 9 4 s 2 .

The  orbitals  in these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in their  common  oxidation  states.  Therefore,  they  are  not  regarded  as transition elements. The  d  orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e.,  s  and  p ), hence, they are more influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules surrounding  them.  In  some  respects,  ions  of  a  given   d n   configuration (n = 1 – 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly filled  d  orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands. The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have been discussed in detail later in this Unit. There  are  greater  similarities  in  the  properties  of  the  transition elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements. However,  some  group  similarities  also  exist.

Fig.  4.1:   Trends  in  melting  points  of transition  elements  The transition metals (with the exception of Zn, Cd and Hg) are very hard and have low volatility. Their melting and boiling points are high.  Fig.  4.1  depicts  the  melting  points  of transition metals belonging to 3 d , 4 d  and 5 d  series. The high melting points of these metals are  attributed  to  the  involvement  of  greater number of electrons from (n-1) d  in addition to the  n s   electrons  in  the  interatomic  metallic bonding. In any row the melting points of these metals  rise  to  a  maximum  at   d 5   except  for anomalous  values  of  Mn  and  Tc  and  fall regularly  as  the  atomic  number  increases.

In  general,  greater  the number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their reactions (see later for electrode potentials). Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the metals  of  the  second  and  third  series  have  greater  enthalpies  of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.  Fig.  4.2  Trends  in  enthalpies of atomisation of transition  elements  In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the new electron enters a  d  orbital each time the nuclear charge increases by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a  d  electron is not  that  effective,  hence  the  net  electrostatic  attraction  between  the nuclear  charge  and  the  outermost  electron  increases  and  the  ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3 d ) to the second (4 d ) series of the elements but the radii of the third (5 d ) series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4 f  orbitals which must be filled before the 5 d  series of elements begin. The filling of 4 f  before  5 d   orbital  results  in  a  regular  decrease  in  atomic  radii  called  Lanthanoid contraction  which essentially compensates for the expected  4.3.2   Variation  in Atomic and Ionic Sizes of Transition Metals  D   a H V   /kJmol –1 "

The net result of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third  d  series exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar physical  and  chemical  properties  much  more  than  that  expected  on the basis of usual family relationship. The  factor  responsible  for  the  lanthanoid contraction is somewhat similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. However,  the  shielding  of  one  4 f   electron  by another  is  less  than  that  of  one   d   electron  by another,  and  as  the  nuclear  charge  increases along the series, there is fairly regular decrease in the size of the entire 4 f  n  orbitals. The decrease in metallic radius coupled with increase  in  atomic  mass  results  in  a  general increase in the density of these elements.

                    "content": "The   d -  and   f -  Block  Elements  Why  do  the  transition  elements  exhibit  higher  enthalpies  of atomisation? Because of large number of unpaired electrons in their atoms they have stronger interatomic interaction and hence stronger bonding between atoms resulting in higher enthalpies of atomisation.  Example  4.2Example  4.2 Example  4.2Example  4.2Example  4.2 SolutionSolution SolutionSolutionSolution  There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner  d  orbitals. Table 4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first series of transition elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much higher along a series. The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of 3 d  series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of 4 s  and 3 d  orbitals. You have learnt that when  d -block elements form ions,  ns  electrons are lost before ( n  – 1)  d  electrons. As we move along the  period  in  3 d   series,  we  see  that  nuclear  charge  increases  from scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell, i.e.,  3 d   orbitals.  These  3 d   electrons  shield  the  4 s   electrons  from  the increasing  nuclear  charge  somewhat  more  effectively  than  the  outer shell  electrons  can  shield  one  another.  Therefore,  the  atomic  radii decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly along the 3 d  series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have  d n  configurations with no 4 s  electrons. A general trend of increasing values of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge increases because one  d  electron does not shield another electron from the influence of nuclear charge because  d -orbitals differ in direction. However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn 2+  and Fe 3+  respectively. In both the  cases,  ions  have   d 5   configuration.  Similar  breaks  occur  at corresponding elements in the later transition series. The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic configuration  d n  is as follows: The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are attraction  of  each  electron  towards  nucleus,  repulsion  between  the  4.3.3   Ionisation Enthalpies  Intext  QuestionIntext  QuestionIntext  QuestionIntext  QuestionIntext  Question  4.2   In the series Sc ( Z  = 21) to Zn ( Z  = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation of zinc is the lowest, i.e., 126 kJ mol –1 .

Exchange  energy  is  approximately proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in the  degenerate  orbitals.  When  several  electrons  occupy  a  set  of degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability increases,  the  ionisation  becomes  more  difficult.  There  is  no  loss  of exchange energy at  d 6  configuration. Mn +  has 3 d 5 4 s 1  configuration and configuration of Cr +  is  d 5 , therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn +  is lower than Cr + . In the same way, Fe 2+  has  d 6  configuration and Mn 2+  has 3 d 5  configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe 2+  is lower than the Mn 2+ . In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is lower than that of Mn.     The  lowest  common  oxidation  state  of  these  metals  is  +2.  To form the M 2+  ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation. The  dominant  term  is  the  second  ionisation  enthalpy which  shows  unusually  high  values  for  Cr  and  Cu  where  M +   ions have the  d 5  and  d 10  configurations respectively. The value for Zn is correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4 s  electron  which  results  in  the  formation  of  stable   d 10   configuration. The  trend  in  the  third  ionisation  enthalpies  is  not  complicated  by the 4 s  orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an electron from the  d 5  (Mn 2+ ) and  d 10  (Zn 2+ ) ions. In general, the third ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third ionisation  enthalpies  of  copper,  nickel  and  zinc  indicate  why  it  is difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements. Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and not amenable to ready generalisation. One of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety of oxidation states these may show in their compounds.

Manganese,  for  example, exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many  d  electrons (hence fewer orbitals available  in  which  to  share  electrons  with  others)  for  higher  valence (Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no  d  electrons are involved). The maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value to  the  sum  of  the   s   and   d   electrons  upto  manganese  (Ti IV O 2 ,  V V O 2 + , Cr V1 O 4 2– , Mn VII O 4 – ) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are Fe II,III , Co II,III ,  Ni II ,  Cu I,II ,  Zn II . The  variability  of  oxidation  states,  a  characteristic  of  transition elements, arises out of incomplete filling of  d  orbitals in such a way that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., V II , V III , V IV , V V . This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non transition  elements  where  oxidation  states  normally  differ  by  a  unit of two. An interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the  d – block  elements  is  noticed  among  the  groups  (groups  4  through  10). Although in the  p –block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the groups  of   d -block.  For  example,  in  group  6,  Mo(VI)  and  W(VI)  are found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO 3  and WO 3  are not. Low  oxidation  states  are  found  when  a  complex  compound  has ligands capable of  p -acceptor character in addition to the  s -bonding. For example, in Ni(CO) 4  and Fe(CO) 5 , the oxidation state of nickel and iron is zero.  Name  a  transition  element  which  does  not  exhibit  variable oxidation states.

An examination of the  E o (M 3+ /M 2+ ) values (Table 4.2) shows the varying trends. The low value for Sc reflects the stability of Sc 3+  which has a noble gas configuration. The highest value for Zn is due to the removal of  an  electron  from  the  stable   d 10   configuration  of  Zn 2+ .  The comparatively  high  value  for  Mn  shows  that  Mn 2+ ( d 5 )  is  particularly stable, whereas comparatively low value for Fe shows the extra stability of Fe 3+  ( d 5 ). The comparatively low value for V is related to the stability of V 2+  (half-filled  t 2g  level, Unit 5). Table 4.5 shows the stable halides of the 3 d  series of transition metals.

The +7 state for Mn is not represented in simple halides but MnO 3 F is known, and beyond Mn no metal has a trihalide except FeX 3  and CoF 3 . The ability of fluorine to stabilise the highest oxidation state is due to either higher lattice energy as in the case of CoF 3 , or higher bond enthalpy terms for the higher covalent compounds, e.g., VF 5  and CrF 6 . Although V    +5  is represented only by VF 5 , the other halides, however, undergo hydrolysis to give oxohalides, VOX 3 .

The  ability  of  oxygen  to  stabilise  the  highest  oxidation  state  is demonstrated in the oxides.

The  E o  (M 2+ /M) values are not regular which can be explained from the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies (   i   i      1   2 H   H   ) and also the  sublimation  enthalpies  which  are  relatively  much  less  for manganese and vanadium. Why is the  E o  value for the Mn 3+ /Mn 2+  couple much more positive than that for Cr 3+ /Cr 2+  or Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ? Explain. Much larger third ionisation energy of Mn (where the required change is  d 5  to  d 4 ) is mainly responsible for this. This also explains why the +3 state of Mn is of little importance.  4.3.9   Magnetic Properties  Transition  metals  vary  widely  in  their  chemical  reactivity.  Many  of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are ‘noble’—that is, they are unaffected by single acids. The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively more  reactive  and  are  oxidised  by  1M  H + ,  though  the  actual  rate  at which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion (H + ) is sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The  E o  values for M 2+ /M  (Table  4.2)  indicate  a  decreasing  tendency  to  form  divalent cations  across  the  series.  This  general  trend  towards  less  negative   E o  values  is  related  to  the  increase  in  the  sum  of  the  first  and  second ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the  E  o  values for Mn, Ni  and  Zn  are  more  negative  than  expected  from  the  general  trend.

Many  of  the transition metal ions are paramagnetic. Paramagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired electrons and is calculated by using the ‘spin-only’ formula, i.e.,      n   n   2      where  n  is  the  number  of  unpaired  electrons  and  μ  is  the  magnetic moment in units of  Bohr magneton (BM) . A single unpaired electron has a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM). The  magnetic  moment  increases  with  the  increasing  number  of unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom, molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the ‘spin-only’ formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row transition elements are given in Table 4.7. The experimental data are mainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state.

This  is  due  to  the  comparatively smaller  sizes  of  the  metal  ions,  their  high  ionic  charges  and  the availability of  d  orbitals for bond formation. The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic activity.  This  activity  is  ascribed  to  their  ability  to  adopt  multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact Process), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3 d  and 4 s   electrons  for  bonding).  This  has  the  effect  of  increasing  the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions. 2 I –  + S 2 O 8 2–   Æ  I 2  + 2 SO 4 2–  An explanation of this catalytic action can be given as: 2 Fe 3+   +  2  I –    Æ   2  Fe 2+   +  I 2  2 Fe 2+  + S 2 O 8 2–   Æ  2 Fe 3+  + 2SO 4 2–  Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent, for  example,  TiC,  Mn 4 N,  Fe 3 H,  VH 0 . 56   and  TiH 1.7 ,  etc.  The  formulas quoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of the metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds are  referred  to  as   interstitial   compounds.  The  principal  physical  and chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows: (i)   They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals. (ii)   They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness. (iii)   They retain metallic conductivity. (iv)   They are chemically inert. An  alloy  is  a  blend  of  metals  prepared  by  mixing  the  components.  Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one metal  are  distributed  randomly  among  the  atoms  of  the  other.  Such alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15 percent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics of  transition  metals,  alloys  are  readily  formed  by  these  metals.  The alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals such  as  brass  (copper-zinc)  and  bronze  (copper-tin),  are  also  of considerable industrial importance.  4.3.12   Catalytic Properties 4.3.13 Formation of Interstitial Compounds 4.3.14 Alloy Formation "

All  the  metals  except  scandium  form MO  oxides  which  are  ionic.  The  highest  oxidation  number  in  the oxides, coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc 2 O 3  to Mn 2 O 7 .  Beyond  group  7,  no  higher  oxides  of  iron  above  Fe 2 O 3   are known. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise V V  as VO 2 + , V IV  as VO 2+   and  Ti IV   as  TiO 2+ . As  the  oxidation  number  of  a  metal  increases,  ionic  character decreases. In the case of Mn, Mn 2 O 7  is a covalent green oil. Even CrO 3  and V 2 O 5  have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic character is predominant. Thus,  Mn 2 O 7   gives  HMnO 4   and  CrO 3   gives  H 2 CrO 4   and  H 2 Cr 2 O 7 . V 2 O 5  is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO 4 3–  as well as VO 2 +  salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic V 2 O 3  to less basic V 2 O 4  and to amphoteric V 2 O 5 . V 2 O 4  dissolves in acids to give VO 2+  salts. Similarly, V 2 O 5  reacts with alkalies as well as acids to give   3 4 VO       and   4 VO     respectively. The well characterised CrO is basic but Cr 2 O 3  is amphoteric.  Potassium  dichromate  K 2 Cr 2 O 7  Potassium  dichromate  is  a  very  important  chemical  used  in  leather industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds. Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are obtained  by  the  fusion  of  chromite  ore  (FeCr 2 O 4 )  with  sodium  or potassium  carbonate  in  free  access  of  air.  The  reaction  with  sodium carbonate occurs as follows: 4 FeCr 2 O 4  + 8 Na 2 CO 3  + 7 O 2   ®  8 Na 2 CrO 4  + 2 Fe 2 O 3  + 8 CO 2  The  yellow  solution  of  sodium  chromate  is  filtered  and  acidified with  sulphuric  acid  to  give  a  solution  from  which  orange  sodium dichromate, Na 2 Cr 2 O 7 .   2H 2 O can be crystallised. 2Na 2 CrO 4  + 2 H +   ®  Na 2 Cr 2 O 7  + 2 Na +  + H 2 O "

These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital theory which is beyond the present scope. The manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral; the  p - bonding takes place by overlap of  p  orbitals of oxygen with  d  orbitals of manganese. The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one unpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the absence of unpaired electron. Acidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide, iron(II)  to  iron(III),  nitrites  to  nitrates  and  iodides  to  free  iodine.

Although many reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential, kinetics  of  the  reaction  is  also  an  important  factor.  Permanganate  at [H + ] = 1 should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow unless either manganese(ll) ions are present or the temperature is raised.

Its uses for the bleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation of oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power.  THE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS (  f -BLOCK)  The  f -block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements following  lanthanum)  and  actinoids  (the  fourteen  elements  following actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is usually  included  in  any  discussion  of  the  lanthanoids  for  which  the general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series. The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly owing  to  the  occurrence  of  a  wide  range  of  oxidation  states  in  these elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems in their study; the two series will be considered separately here. The  names,  symbols,  electronic  configurations  of  atomic  and  some ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids (for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9.  4 . 54 . 5  4 . 5 4 . 5 4 . 5  T h e T h e T h eT h e T h e  LanthanoidsLanthanoids LanthanoidsLanthanoidsLanthanoids "

However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive ions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the form 4 f  n  (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number). The  overall  decrease  in  atomic  and  ionic  radii  from  lanthanum  to lutetium  (the   lanthanoid  contraction )    is  a  unique  feature  in  the chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching consequences  in  the  chemistry  of  the  third transition series of the elements. The decrease in atomic radii (derived from the structures of metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in M 3+   ions  (Fig.  4.6).  This  contraction  is,  of course, similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to the same cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same sub-shell. However, the shielding of one 4  f  electron by another is less than one  d  electron by another with the increase in  nuclear  charge  along  the  series.  There  is fairly  regular  decrease  in  the  sizes  with increasing atomic number. The cumulative effect of the contraction of the  lanthanoid  series,  known  as   lanthanoid contraction ,  causes  the  radii  of  the  members of the third transition series to be very similar to those of the corresponding members of the second series. The almost identical radii of Zr (160  pm)  and  Hf  (159  pm),  a  consequence  of the  lanthanoid  contraction,  account  for  their occurrence  together  in  nature  and  for  the difficulty faced in their separation. In  the  lanthanoids,  La(II)  and  Ln(III)  compounds  are  predominant species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid compounds  are  also  obtained.  This  irregularity  (as  in  ionisation enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled or  filled   f   subshell.  Thus,  the  formation  of  Ce IV   is  favoured  by  its noble  gas  configuration,  but  it  is  a  strong  oxidant  reverting  to  the common  +3  state.  The   E o   value  for  Ce 4+ /  Ce 3+   is  +  1.74  V  which suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very slow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO 2 . Eu 2+  is formed by losing the two  s  electrons and its  f  7  configuration accounts for the formation of this ion. However, Eu 2+  is a strong reducing agent changing to the common  +3  state.  Similarly  Yb 2+   which  has   f   14   configuration  is  a reductant.  Tb IV   has  half-filled   f -orbitals  and  is  an  oxidant.  The behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both +2 and +3 oxidation states.  4.5.3   Oxidation States  Fig.  4.6:   Trends  in  ionic  radii  of  lanthanoids "

The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being steel  hard.  Their  melting  points  range  between  1000  to  1200  K  but samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are good  conductors  of  heat  and  electricity.  Density  and  other  properties change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm. Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to the presence of  f  electrons. Neither La 3+  nor Lu 3+  ion shows any colour but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably because  of  the  excitation  within   f   level.  The  lanthanoid  ions  other than  the   f   0  type (La 3+   and  Ce 4+ )  and  the   f   14   type  (Yb 2+   and  Lu 3+ )  are all paramagnetic. The  first  ionisation  enthalpies  of  the  lanthanoids  are  around 600 kJ mol –1 , the second about 1200 kJ mol –1  comparable with those of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in 3 d   orbitals  of  the  first  transition  series),  appear  to  impart  a  certain degree  of  stability  to  empty,  half-filled  and  completely  filled  orbitals  f   level.  This  is  indicated  from  the  abnormally  low  value  of  the  third ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium. In their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number, they behave more like aluminium.

The carbides, Ln 3 C, Ln 2 C 3  and LnC 2  are formed when the metals are heated with  carbon.  They  liberate  hydrogen from dilute acids and burn in halogens to form halides.

A well known alloy is  mischmetall  which consists of a lanthanoid metal (~ 95%) and iron (~ 5%) and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of  mischmetall  is used in Mg-based alloy to produce bullets, shell and lighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in petroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors in television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces. The actinoids include the fourteen elements from Th to Lr.

                    "content": "Chemistry  The actinoids are radioactive elements and the earlier members have relatively long half-lives, the latter ones have half-life values ranging from a day to 3 minutes for lawrencium ( Z  =103). The latter members could be prepared  only  in  nanogram  quantities.  These  facts  render  their  study more difficult. All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s 2  and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons are  formally  added  to  5 f ,  though  not  in  thorium  (Z  =  90)  but  from  Pa onwards the 5 f  orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids are  related  to  the  stabilities  of  the   f    0 ,   f    7   and   f     14   occupancies  of  the  5f orbitals.  Thus,  the  configurations  of  Am  and  Cm  are  [Rn]  5 f   7 7 s 2   and [Rn] 5 f  7 6 d 1 7 s 2 . Although the 5 f  orbitals resemble the 4 f  orbitals in their angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4 f  orbitals and hence 5 f  electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent. The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well. There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M 3+  ions across the series. This may be referred to as the  actinoid contraction  (like lanthanoid contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element in this series resulting from poor shielding by 5 f  electrons. There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to the  fact  that  the  5 f ,  6 d   and  7 s   levels  are  of  comparable  energies.  The known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11. The actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example, the maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7 respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table 4.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds in +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse. Because  the  distribution  of  oxidation  states  among  the  actinoids  is  so uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.  4.6.1   Electronic Configurations 4.6.2 Ionic Sizes 4.6.3 Oxidation States  The actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display  a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained due  to  irregularities  in  metallic  radii  which  are  far  greater than in lanthanoids.  4.6.4  General Characteristics and Comparison with Lanthanoids  Ac   Th   Pa   U   Np   Pu   Am   Cm   Bk   Cf   Es   Fm   Md   No   Lr  3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3 4   4   4   4   4   4   4   4 5   5   5   5   5 6   6   6   6 7   7  Table  4.11:  Oxidation  States  of  Actinium  and  Actinoids "

                    "content": "The   d -  and   f -  Block  Elements  The actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided. The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide and  hydride  and  combination  with  most  non  metals  takes  place  at moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide layers; alkalies have no action. The magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility of  the  actinoids  with  the  number  of  unpaired  5   f   electrons  is  roughly parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have higher values. It is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to be expected that when 5 f  orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5 f  electrons, will therefore, be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4 f  electrons of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids. A comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar to  that  of  the  lanthanoids  is  not  evident  until  the  second  half  of  the actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid and  actinoid  contractions,  have  extended  effects  on  the  sizes,  and therefore,  the  properties  of  the  elements  succeeding  them  in  their respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known at the present time.  4 . 74 . 7  4 . 7 4 . 7 4 . 7  SomeSomeSomeSomeSome ApplicationsApplications ApplicationsApplicationsApplications of  d-  andof  d-  and of  d-  andof  d-  andof  d-  and f-Blockf-Block f-Blockf-Blockf-Block ElementsElements ElementsElementsElements  Iron  and  steels  are  the  most  important  construction  materials.

Many of the metals and/or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical industry.  V 2 O 5   catalyses  the  oxidation  of  SO 2   in  the  manufacture  of sulphuric acid. TiCl 4  with A1(CH 3 ) 3  forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts used to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in the Haber process for the production of ammonia from N 2 /H 2  mixtures. Nickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker process the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by PdCl 2 . Nickel complexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic compounds  such  as  benzene.  The  photographic  industry  relies  on  the special light-sensitive properties of AgBr.  The   d -block   consisting  of   Groups  3-12   occupies  the  large  middle  section  of  the   periodic table .  In  these  elements  the  inner   d   orbitals  are  progressively  filled.  The   f -block   is  placed  outside   at  the   bottom   of  the   periodic  table   and  in  the  elements  of  this  block,  4 f   and 5 f   orbitals  are  progressively  filled. Corresponding  to  the  filling  of  3 d ,  4 d   and  5 d   orbitals,  three  series  of  transition elements  are  well  recognised.  All  the  transition  elements  exhibit  typical  metallic  properties such  as  –high  tensile  strength,  ductility,  malleability,  thermal  and  electrical  conductivity and  metallic  character.  Their  melting  and  boiling  points  are  high  which  are  attributed to  the  involvement  of  ( n  –1)  d   electrons  resulting  into   strong  interatomic  bonding .  In many  of  these  properties,  the  maxima  occur  at  about  the  middle  of  each  series  which indicates that one unpaired electron per  d  orbital is particularly a favourable configuration for  strong  interatomic  interaction.  Successive  ionisation  enthalpies   do  not  increase  as  steeply  as  in  the  main  group elements  with  increasing  atomic  number.  Hence,  the  loss  of  variable  number  of  electrons from ( n  –1)  d  orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of  ( n  –1)  d  electrons  in  the  behaviour  of  transition  elements  impart  certain  distinct  characteristics  to  these elements.  Thus,  in  addition  to  variable  oxidation  states,  they  exhibit  paramagnetic behaviour,  catalytic  properties  and  tendency  for  the  formation  of  coloured  ions,  interstitial compounds  and  complexes. The   transition  elements   vary  widely  in  their  chemical  behaviour.  Many  of  them  are sufficiently  electropositive  to  dissolve  in  mineral  acids,  although  a  few  are  ‘noble’.  Of  the first  series,  with  the  exception  of  copper,  all  the  metals  are  relatively  reactive. The  transition  metals  react  with  a  number  of  non-metals  like  oxygen,  nitrogen, sulphur  and  halogens  to  form  binary  compounds.  The  first  series  transition  metal  oxides are  generally  formed  from  the  reaction  of  metals  with  oxygen  at  high  temperatures.  These oxides  dissolve  in  acids  and  bases  to  form  oxometallic  salts.  Potassium  dichromate  and potassium  permanganate  are  common  examples.  Potassium  dichromate  is  prepared  from the  chromite  ore  by  fusion  with  alkali  in  presence  of  air  and  acidifying  the  extract. Pyrolusite  ore  (MnO 2 )  is  used  for  the  preparation  of  potassium  permanganate.  Both  the dichromate  and  the  permanganate  ions  are  strong  oxidising  agents. The  two  series  of   inner  transition  elements ,   lanthanoids   and   actinoids   constitute the   f -block   of  the  periodic  table.  With  the  successive  filling  of  the  inner  orbitals,  4 f ,  there is  a  gradual  decrease  in  the  atomic  and  ionic  sizes  of  these  metals  along  the  series ( lanthanoid  contraction ).  This  has  far  reaching  consequences  in  the  chemistry  of  the elements  succeeding  them.  Lanthanum  and  all  the  lanthanoids  are  rather  soft  white metals.  They  react  easily  with  water  to  give  solutions  giving  +3  ions.

                    "content": "Chemistry  In the previous Unit we learnt that the transition metals form a large number of  complex compounds  in which the metal atoms are bound to a number of anions or neutral molecules by sharing of electrons. In modern terminology such compounds are called  coordination compounds . The chemistry of coordination compounds is  an  important  and  challenging  area  of  modern inorganic chemistry. New concepts of chemical bonding and  molecular  structure  have  provided  insights  into the functioning of these compounds as vital components of  biological  systems.  Chlorophyll,  haemoglobin  and vitamin B 12  are coordination compounds of magnesium, iron  and  cobalt  respectively.  Variety  of  metallurgical processes, industrial catalysts and analytical reagents involve  the  use  of  coordination  compounds. Coordination compounds also find many applications in electroplating, textile dyeing and medicinal chemistry.  Coordination Compounds After  studying  this  Unit,  you  will  be able  to •   appreciate  the  postulates  of Werner’s  theory  of  coordination compounds; •   know  the  meaning  of  the  terms: coordination entity, central atom/ ion,  ligand,  coordination  number, coordination  sphere,  coordination polyhedron,  oxidation  number, homoleptic  and  heteroleptic; •   learn  the  rules  of  nomenclature of  coordination  compounds; •   write  the  formulas  and  names of  mononuclear  coordination compounds; •   define  different  types  of  isomerism in  coordination  compounds; •   understand the nature of bonding in  coordination  compounds  in terms  of  the  Valence  Bond  and Crystal  Field  theories; •   appreciate  the  importance  and applications  of  coordination compounds in our day to day life.  Objectives  Coordination Compounds are the backbone of modern inorganic and  bio–inorganic  chemistry  and  chemical  industry.  Coordination Compounds  Alfred Werner  (1866-1919), a Swiss chemist was the first to formulate his ideas about the structures of coordination compounds. He prepared and  characterised  a  large  number  of  coordination  compounds  and studied their physical and chemical behaviour by simple experimental techniques.  Werner proposed the concept of a  primary valence   and a   secondary  valence   for  a  metal  ion.  Binary  compounds  such  as CrCl 3 , CoCl 2  or PdCl 2  have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively. In a series of compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia, it was found that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as AgCl on adding  excess  silver  nitrate  solution  in  cold  but  some  remained  in solution.  5 . 15 . 1  5 . 15 . 1 5 . 1  Werner’Werner’Werner’Werner’Werner’ss sss Theory  ofTheory  of Theory  ofTheory  ofTheory  of CoordinationCoordinationCoordinationCoordinationCoordination CompoundsCompoundsCompoundsCompoundsCompounds  5 UnitUnit UnitUnitUnit  5 "

Werner  proposed  the  term   secondary  valence   for  the number  of  groups  bound  directly  to  the  metal  ion;  in  each  of  these examples the secondary valences are six. Note that the last two compounds in Table 5.1 have identical empirical formula,  CoCl 3 .4NH 3 ,  but  distinct  properties.  Such  compounds  are termed  as  isomers.  Werner  in  1898,  propounded  his  theory  of coordination compounds. The main postulates are:  1.   In  coordination  compounds  metals  show  two  types  of  linkages (valences)-primary and secondary.  2.   The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by negative ions.  3.   The  secondary  valences  are  non  ionisable.  These  are  satisfied  by neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to the coordination number and is fixed for a metal.  4.   The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have characteristic  spatial  arrangements  corresponding  to  different coordination numbers. In  modern  formulations,  such  spatial  arrangements  are  called coordination   polyhedra .  The  species  within  the  square  bracket  are coordination  entities  or  complexes  and  the  ions  outside  the  square bracket are called counter ions. He further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of transition metals. Thus, [Co(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+ , [CoCl(NH 3 ) 5 ] 2+  and [CoCl 2 (NH 3 ) 4 ] +  are octahedral entities, while [Ni(CO) 4 ] and [PtCl 4 ] 2–  are tetrahedral and square planar, respectively.

His  study  of  chemistry  began  in  Karlsruhe  (Germany) and  continued  in  Zurich  (Switzerland),  where  in  his doctoral  thesis  in  1890,  he  explained  the  difference  in properties  of  certain  nitrogen  containing  organic substances  on  the  basis  of  isomerism.  He  extended  vant Hoff’s  theory  of  tetrahedral  carbon  atom  and  modified it  for  nitrogen.  Werner  showed  optical  and  electrical  differences  between complex  compounds  based  on  physical  measurements.  In  fact,  Werner  was the  first  to  discover  optical  activity  in  certain  coordination  compounds. He,  at  the  age  of  29  years  became  a  full  professor  at  Technische Hochschule  in  Zurich  in  1895.  Alfred  Werner  was  a  chemist  and  educationist. His  accomplishments  included  the  development  of  the  theory  of  coordination compounds.  This  theory,  in  which  Werner  proposed  revolutionary  ideas  about how  atoms  and  molecules  are  linked  together,  was  formulated  in  a  span  of only  three  years,  from  1890  to  1893.  The  remainder  of  his  career  was  spent gathering  the  experimental  support  required  to  validate  his  new  ideas.  Werner became  the  first  Swiss  chemist  to  win  the  Nobel  Prize  in  1913  for  his  work on  the  linkage  of  atoms  and  the  coordination  theory.

                    "content": "Coordination  Compounds  ( a )  Coordination  entity  A coordination entity constitutes a central metal atom or ion bonded to a fixed number of ions or molecules. For example, [CoCl 3 (NH 3 ) 3 ] is a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by three ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples are [Ni(CO) 4 ], [PtCl 2 (NH 3 ) 2 ], [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4– , [Co(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+ .  (b)   Central  atom/ion  In a coordination entity, the atom/ion to which a fixed number of ions/groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement around  it,  is  called  the  central  atom  or  ion.  For  example,  the central  atom/ion  in  the  coordination  entities:  [NiCl 2 (H 2 O) 4 ], [CoCl(NH 3 ) 5 ] 2+   and  [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3–   are  Ni 2+ ,  Co 3+   and  Fe 3+ ,  respectively. These  central  atoms/ions  are  also  referred  to  as   Lewis  acids .  ( c )  Ligands  The  ions  or  molecules  bound  to  the  central  atom/ion  in  the coordination  entity  are  called  ligands.  These  may  be  simple  ions such as Cl – , small molecules such as H 2 O or NH 3 , larger molecules such as H 2 NCH 2 CH 2 NH 2  or N(CH 2 CH 2 NH 2 ) 3  or even macromolecules, such as proteins. When a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor atom, as with Cl – , H 2 O or NH 3 , the ligand is said to be  unidentate.  When  a  ligand  can  bind  through  two  donor  atoms  as  in H 2 NCH 2 CH 2 NH 2   (ethane-1,2-diamine)  or  C 2 O 4 2–   (oxalate),  the ligand is said to be  didentate  and when several donor atoms are present in a single ligand as in N(CH 2 CH 2 NH 2 ) 3 , the ligand is said to be  polydentate . Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA 4– ) is an  important  hexadentate  ligand.  It  can  bind  through  two nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion. When  a  di-  or  polydentate  ligand  uses  its  two  or  more  donor atoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a  chelate  ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the  denticity  of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes tend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate ligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of the two ligetes in the complex is called  ambidentate ligand . Examples of such ligands are the NO 2 –  and SCN –  ions. NO 2 –  ion can coordinate either through nitrogen  or  through  oxygen  to  a  central  metal atom/ion. Similarly,  SCN –   ion  can  coordinate  through  the sulphur or nitrogen atom.  ( d )  Coordination  number  The coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be defined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is directly  bonded.  For  example,  in  the  complex  ions,  [PtCl 6 ] 2–   and [Ni(NH 3 ) 4 ] 2+ ,  the  coordination  number  of  Pt  and  Ni  are  6  and  4 respectively.  Similarly,  in  the  complex  ions,  [Fe(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3–   and [Co(en) 3 ] 3+ , the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because C 2 O 4 2–  and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands.  5 . 25 . 2  5 . 25 . 2 5 . 2  Definitions  ofDefinitions  ofDefinitions  ofDefinitions  ofDefinitions  of SomeSome SomeSomeSome ImportantImportantImportantImportantImportant TermsTerms TermsTermsTerms Pertaining  toPertaining  toPertaining  toPertaining  toPertaining  to CoordinationCoordinationCoordinationCoordinationCoordination CompoundsCompounds CompoundsCompoundsCompounds "

                    "content": "Chemistry  It is important to note here that coordination number of the central atom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by the ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the ligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.  (e)   Coordination sphere  The central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in square  bracket  and  is  collectively  termed  as  the   coordination sphere . The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and are called counter ions. For example, in the complex K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ], the coordination sphere is [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4–  and the counter ion is K + .  ( f )  Coordination  polyhedron  The spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly attached  to  the  central  atom/ion  defines  a  coordination polyhedron  about  the  central  atom.  The  most  common coordination  polyhedra  are  octahedral,  square  planar  and tetrahedral. For example, [Co(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+  is octahedral, [Ni(CO) 4 ] is tetrahedral  and  [PtCl 4 ] 2–   is  square  planar.

The oxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis following the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation number of copper in [Cu(CN) 4 ] 3–  is +1 and it is written as Cu(I).  ( h )  Homoleptic  and  heteroleptic  complexes  Complexes  in  which  a  metal  is  bound  to  only  one  kind  of  donor groups,  e.g. , [Co(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+ , are known as homoleptic. Complexes in which  a  metal  is  bound  to  more  than  one  kind  of  donor  groups,  e.g. , [Co(NH 3 ) 4 Cl 2 ] + , are known as heteroleptic. Nomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the need  to  have  an  unambiguous  method  of  describing  formulas  and writing systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers. The formulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the recommendations  of  the  International  Union  of  Pure  and  Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).

For example, [Co(CN) 6 ] 3– , [Cr(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+ , etc. (vii)   The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s). The  names  of  coordination  compounds  are  derived  by  following  the principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers. The following rules are used when naming coordination compounds: (i)   The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged coordination entities. (ii)   The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the central atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula). (iii)   Names of the anionic ligands end in –o, those of neutral and cationic ligands are the same except aqua for H 2 O, ammine for NH 3 , carbonyl for CO and nitrosyl for NO. While writing the formula of coordination entity, these are enclosed in brackets ( ). (iv)   Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the individual ligands in the coordination entity. When the names of the ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms,  bis ,  tris ,  tetrakis  are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in parentheses. For example, [NiCl 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 ] is named as dichloridobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II). (v)   Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination entity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis. (vi)   If  the  complex  ion  is  a  cation,  the  metal  is  named  same  as  the element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and  Pt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of the metal ends with the suffix – ate. For example, Co in a complex anion,        2 4 Co   SCN               is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin names are used in the complex anions,  e .g., ferrate for Fe.  5.3.2   Naming of Mononuclear Coordination Compounds  Note :  The  2004  IUPAC draft  recommends  that ligands  will  be  sorted alphabetically, irrespective  of  charge.  Note :  The  2004 IUPAC  draft recommends  that anionic  ligands  will end  with–ido  so  that chloro  would  become chlorido,  etc.  5.3.1 Formulas of Mononuclear Coordination Entities "

The  following  examples  illustrate  the  nomenclature  for  coordination compounds.  1.   [Cr(NH 3 ) 3 (H 2 O) 3 ]Cl 3  is named as: triamminetriaquachromium(III) chloride  Explanation :   The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is a  cation.  The  amine  ligands  are  named  before  the  aqua  ligands according to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in the compound, the charge on the complex ion must be +3 (since the compound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex ion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation number of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral molecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be the same as the charge of the complex  ion, +3.  2.   [Co(H 2 NCH 2 CH 2 NH 2 ) 3 ] 2 (SO 4 ) 3  is named as: tris(ethane-1,2–diamine)cobalt(III) sulphate  Explanation : The sulphate is the counter anion in this molecule. Since it takes 3 sulphates to bond with two complex cations, the charge on each complex cation must be +3. Further, ethane-1,2– diamine is a neutral molecule, so the oxidation number of cobalt in the complex ion must be +3.

Because of the different arrangement of atoms, they differ in one or more physical or chemical properties.  Two  principal  types  of  isomerism  are  known  among coordination compounds.

Structural isomers have  different  bonds.  A  detailed  account  of  these  isomers  are given below. This type of isomerism arises in heteroleptic complexes  due  to  different  possible  geometric arrangements of the ligands. Important examples of  this  behaviour  are  found  with  coordination numbers 4 and 6. In a square planar complex of formula  [MX 2 L 2 ]  (X  and  L  are  unidentate),  the two ligands X may be arranged adjacent to each other in a  cis  isomer, or opposite to each other in a  trans  isomer as depicted in Fig. 5.2.

Another  type  of  geometrical isomerism  occurs  in  octahedral coordination  entities  of  the  type [Ma 3 b 3 ]  like  [Co(NH 3 ) 3 (NO 2 ) 3 ].  If three  donor  atoms  of  the  same ligands occupy adjacent positions at  the  corners  of  an  octahedral face,  we  have  the   facial  (fac) isomer .

A  simple  example  is  provided  by  complexes containing the thiocyanate ligand, NCS – , which may bind through the nitrogen to give M–NCS or through sulphur to give M–SCN. Jørgensen discovered such behaviour in the complex [Co(NH 3 ) 5 (NO 2 )]Cl 2 , which is obtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligand   is bound through oxygen (–ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through nitrogen (–NO 2 ). This type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex. An example is provided by [Co(NH 3 ) 6 ][Cr(CN) 6 ], in which the NH 3  ligands are  bound  to  Co 3+   and  the  CN –   ligands  to  Cr 3+ .

Thus,  the  complex  has  octahedral  geometry  and  is diamagnetic because of the absence of unpaired electron. In the formation of this complex, since the inner  d  orbital (3 d ) is used in hybridisation, the complex, [Co(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+  is called an  inner orbital  or  low spin  or  spin paired complex .  The  paramagnetic  octahedral  complex,  [CoF 6 ] 3–   uses outer orbital (4 d  ) in hybridisation ( sp 3 d 2 ). It is thus called  outer orbital  or   high  spin   or   spin  free  complex .

An example is [Ni(CN) 4 ] 2– . Here nickel is in +2 oxidation state and has the electronic configuration 3 d 8 . The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram: Each of the hybridised orbitals receives a pair of electrons from a cyanide ion. The compound is diamagnetic as evident from the absence of unpaired electron. It is important to note that the hybrid orbitals do not actually exist. In fact, hybridisation is a mathematical manipulation of wave equation for the atomic orbitals involved. The  magnetic  moment  of  coordination  compounds  can  be  measured by the magnetic susceptibility experiments. The results can be used to obtain information about the number of unpaired electrons and hence structures adopted by metal complexes. A critical study of the magnetic data of coordination compounds of metals  of  the  first  transition  series  reveals  some  complications.  For metal ions with upto three electrons in the  d  orbitals, like Ti 3+  ( d 1 ); V 3+  ( d 2 );  Cr 3+   ( d 3 );  two  vacant   d   orbitals  are  available  for  octahedral hybridisation with 4 s  and 4 p  orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these free  ions  and  their  coordination  entities  is  similar.  When  more  than three  3 d   electrons  are  present,  the  required  pair  of  3 d   orbitals  for octahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of Hund’s  rule).  Thus,  for   d 4   (Cr 2+ ,  Mn 3+ ),   d 5   (Mn 2+ ,  Fe 3+ ),   d 6   (Fe 2+ ,  Co 3+ ) cases, a vacant pair of  d  orbitals results only by pairing of 3 d  electrons which leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively. The magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases, especially  with  coordination  compounds  containing   d 6   ions.  However, with species containing  d 4  and  d 5  ions there are complications. [Mn(CN) 6 ] 3–  has magnetic moment of two unpaired electrons while [MnCl 6 ] 3–  has a paramagnetic moment of four unpaired electrons. [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3–  has magnetic moment of a single unpaired electron while [FeF 6 ] 3–  has a paramagnetic moment  of  five  unpaired  electrons.  [CoF 6 ] 3–   is  paramagnetic  with  four unpaired  electrons  while  [Co(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3–   is  diamagnetic.  This  apparent anomaly is explained by valence bond theory in terms of formation of inner orbital and outer orbital coordination entities. [Mn(CN) 6 ] 3– , [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3–  and [Co(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3–  are inner orbital complexes involving  d 2 sp 3  hybridisation, the former two complexes are paramagnetic and the latter diamagnetic.

(ii)   It does not give quantitative interpretation of magnetic data. (iii)   It does not explain the colour exhibited by coordination compounds. (iv)   It does not give a quantitative interpretation of the thermodynamic or kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds. (v)   It does not make exact predictions regarding the tetrahedral and square planar structures of 4-coordinate complexes. (vi)   It does not distinguish between weak and strong ligands. The crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers the  metal-ligand  bond  to  be  ionic  arising  purely  from  electrostatic interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated as point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral molecules. The five  d  orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion have  same  energy,   i.e.,   they  are  degenerate.  This  degeneracy  is maintained  if  a  spherically  symmetrical  field  of  negative  charges surrounds  the  metal  atom/ion.  However,  when  this  negative  field  is due to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules like  NH 3   and  H 2 O)  in  a  complex,  it  becomes  asymmetrical  and  the degeneracy  of  the   d   orbitals  is  lifted.  It  results  in  splitting  of  the   d  orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.  ( a )  Crystal  field  splitting  in  octahedral  coordination  entities  In an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding the metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in metal  d  orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands. Such a repulsion is more when the metal  d  orbital is directed towards the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the  2   2 x   y  d and   2 z d    orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of the  ligand  will  experience  more  repulsion  and  will  be  raised  in energy; and the  d xy ,  d yz  and  d xz  orbitals which are directed between the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the  d  orbitals has been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy,  t 2g  set  and  two  orbitals  of  higher  energy,   e g   set.

Some ligands  are  able  to  produce strong fields in which case, the splitting will be large whereas others  produce  weak  fields and  consequently  result  in small  splitting  of   d   orbitals. In general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing field strength as given below: I –  < Br –  < SCN  –  < Cl –  < S 2–  < F  –  < OH –  < C 2 O 4 2–  < H 2 O < NCS –  < edta 4–  < NH 3  < en < CN  –  < CO Such  a  series  is  termed  as   spectrochemical  series .  It  is  an experimentally  determined  series  based  on  the  absorption  of  light by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the  d  orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously, the single  d  electron occupies one of the lower energy  t 2g  orbitals. In  d 2  and  d 3  coordination entities, the  d  electrons occupy the  t 2g  orbitals singly in accordance with the Hund’s rule. For  d 4  ions, two possible patterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could either enter the  t 2g  level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the  e g  level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative magnitude of the crystal field splitting,  D o  and the pairing energy, P (P  represents  the  energy  required  for  electron  pairing  in  a  single orbital). The two options are: (i)   If  D o  < P, the fourth electron enters one of the  e g  orbitals giving the configuration  3   1 2g   g t   e   . Ligands for which  D o  < P are known as  weak field ligands  and form high spin complexes. (ii)   If  D o  > P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth electron to occupy a  t 2g  orbital with configuration  t 2g 4 e g 0 . Ligands which produce this effect are known as  strong field ligands  and form low spin complexes. Calculations show that  d 4  to  d 7  coordination entities are more stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases.  Fig.5.8:     d  orbital  splitting  in  an  octahedral  crystal  field "

In  the  previous  Unit,  we  learnt  that  one  of  the  most  distinctive properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours. This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from white light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges is  no  longer  white.  The  colour  of  the  complex  is  complementary  to that  which  is  absorbed.  The  complementary  colour  is  the  colour generated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by the  complex,  it  appears  red.  Table  5.3  gives  the  relationship  of  the different wavelength absorbed and the colour observed.  5.5.5   Colour in Coordination Compounds  Coordinaton entity Wavelength  of  light absorbed  (nm) Colour  of  light a b s o r b e d  Colour  of  coordination entity Table  5.3: Relationship  between  the  Wavelength  of  Light  absorbed  and  the Colour  observed  in  some  Coordination  Entities  [CoCl(NH 3 ) 5 ] 2+   535   Yellow   Violet [Co(NH 3 ) 5 (H 2 O)] 3+   500   Blue  Green   Red [Co(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+   475   Blue   Yellow  Orange [Co(CN) 6 ] 3–   310   Ultraviolet   Pale  Yellow [Cu(H 2 O) 4 ] 2+   600   Red   Blue [Ti(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+   498   Blue  Green   Violet  The colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained in terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex [Ti(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+ ,  which  is  violet  in  colour.  This  is  an  octahedral  complex where the single electron (Ti 3+  is a 3 d 1  system) in the metal  d  orbital is in the  t 2g  level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state available for the electron is the empty  e g  level. If light corresponding to the energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would excite  the  electron  from   t 2g   level  to  the   e g   level  ( t 2g 1 e g 0    Æ    t 2g 0 e g 1 ). Consequently,  the  complex  appears  violet  in  colour  (Fig.  5.10).  The crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds to  d-d  transition of the electron.  ( b )  Crystal  field  splitting  in  tetrahedral  coordination  entities  In tetrahedral coordination entity formation, the  d  orbital splitting (Fig. 5.9) is inverted and is smaller as compared to the octahedral field splitting. For the same metal, the same ligands  and  metal-ligand  distances,  it  can be shown that  D t  = (4/9)  D 0 . Consequently, the  orbital  splitting  energies  are  not sufficiently  large  for  forcing  pairing  and, therefore, low spin configurations are rarely observed.  The  ‘g’  subscript  is  used  for  the octahedral  and  square  planar  complexes which  have  centre  of  symmetry.  Since  tetrahedral  complexes  lack  symmetry,  ‘g’ subscript is not used with energy levels.  Not  in  visible region "

The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end of the spectrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account the covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central atom.

The  metal-carbon  bond  in  metal  carbonyls possess both   s   and  p   character. The M–C  s   bond is formed by the donation of lone pair of electrons on  the  carbonyl  carbon  into  a  vacant  orbital  of the  metal.  The  M–C   p   bond  is  formed  by  the donation of a pair of electrons from a filled  d  orbital of metal into the vacant antibonding  p *   orbital of carbon  monoxide.  The  metal  to  ligand  bonding creates  a  synergic  effect  which  strengthens  the bond between CO and the metal (Fig.5.14).  Fig.  5.14:   Example  of  synergic  bonding interactions  in  a  carbonyl complex.  The coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds are  widely  present  in  the  mineral,  plant  and  animal  worlds  and  are known  to  play  many  important  functions  in  the  area  of  analytical chemistry, metallurgy, biological systems, industry and medicine. These are described below: •   Coordination  compounds  find  use  in  many  qualitative  and quantitative chemical analysis. The familiar colour reactions given by metal ions with a number of ligands (especially chelating ligands), as a result of formation of coordination entities, form the basis for their detection and estimation by classical and instrumental methods of  analysis.  Examples  of  such  reagents  include  EDTA,  DMG (dimethylglyoxime),  a –nitroso– b –naphthol, cupron, etc. •   Hardness of water is estimated by simple titration with Na 2 EDTA. The  Ca 2+   and  Mg 2+   ions  form  stable  complexes  with  EDTA.  The selective estimation of these ions can be done due to difference in the stability constants of calcium and magnesium complexes. •   Some important extraction processes of metals, like those of silver and gold, make use of complex formation. Gold, for example, combines with cyanide in the presence of oxygen and water to form the coordination entity [Au(CN) 2 ] –  in aqueous solution. Gold can be separated in metallic form from this solution by the addition of zinc. •   Similarly, purification of metals can be achieved through formation and subsequent decomposition of their coordination compounds.

During  the  last  fifty  years,  advances  in  this area,  have  provided  development  of  new  concepts  and  models  of  bonding  and molecular  structure,  novel  breakthroughs  in   chemical  industry   and  vital insights  into  the  functioning  of  critical  components  of   biological  systems . The  first  systematic  attempt  at  explaining  the  formation,  reactions,  structure and  bonding  of  a  coordination  compound  was  made  by   A.  Werner .  His  theory postulated  the  use  of  two  types  of   linkages   ( primary   and   secondary )  by  a metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry these  linkages  are  recognised  as  the  ionisable  (ionic)  and  non-ionisable  (covalent) bonds,  respectively.  Using  the  property  of  isomerism,  Werner  predicted  the geometrical  shapes  of  a  large  number  of  coordination  entities.  The  Valence  Bond  Theory  (VBT)   explains  with  reasonable  success,  the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It,  however,  fails  to  provide  a  quantitative  interpretation  of  magnetic  behaviour and  has  nothing  to  say  about  the  optical  properties  of  these  compounds.  The  Crystal  Field  Theory  (CFT)   to  coordination  compounds  is  based  on the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges),  For  example,  impure  nickel  is  converted  to  [Ni(CO) 4 ],  which  is decomposed  to  yield  pure  nickel. •   Coordination  compounds  are  of  great  importance  in  biological systems. The pigment responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll, is a coordination compound of magnesium. Haemoglobin, the red pigment  of  blood  which  acts  as  oxygen  carrier  is  a  coordination compound  of  iron.  Vitamin  B 12 ,  cyanocobalamine,  the  anti– pernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt. Among  the  other  compounds  of  biological  importance  with coordinated  metal  ions  are  the  enzymes  like,  carboxypeptidase  A and carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems). •   Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial processes.  Examples  include  rhodium  complex,  [(Ph 3 P) 3 RhCl],  a Wilkinson catalyst, is used for the hydrogenation of alkenes. •   Articles  can  be  electroplated  with  silver  and  gold  much  more smoothly  and  evenly  from  solutions  of  the  complexes,  [Ag(CN) 2 ] –  and [Au(CN) 2 ] –  than from a solution of simple metal ions. •   In  black  and  white  photography,  the  developed  film  is  fixed  by washing  with  hypo  solution  which  dissolves  the  undecomposed AgBr to form a complex ion, [Ag(S 2 O 3 ) 2 ] 3– . •   There is growing interest in the use of chelate therapy in medicinal chemistry. An example is the treatment of problems caused by the  presence of metals in toxic proportions in plant/animal systems. Thus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands D–penicillamine and desferrioxime B via the formation of coordination compounds. EDTA is used in the treatment of lead poisoning. Some coordination compounds of platinum effectively inhibit the growth of tumours. Examples are:  cis –platin and related compounds. "

General Principles and Processes of Isolation of Elements General Principles and Processes of Isolation of Elements  6 UnitUnitUnitUnitUnit  The history of civilisation is linked to the use of metals in antiquity in many ways. Different periods of early human  civilisations  have  been  named  after  metals. The  skill  of  extraction  of  metals  gave  many  metals and  brought  about  several  changes  in  the  human society. It gave weapons, tools, ornaments, utensils, etc., and enriched the cultural life. The  ‘Seven metals of antiquity’ , as they are sometimes called, are gold, copper, silver, lead, tin, iron and mercury. Although modern  metallurgy  had  exponential  growth  after Industrial  Revolution,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that many modern concepts in metallurgy have their roots in  ancient  practices  that  pre-dated  the  Industrial  Revolution.  For  over  7000  years,  India  has  had  a rich tradition of metallurgical skills. The two important sources for the history of Indian metallurgy are archaeological excavations and literary evidences.  The  first  evidence  of  metal  in  Indian subcontinent comes from Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, where  a  small  copper  bead,  dated  to  about  6000 BCE  was  found.  It  is  however  thought  to  be  native copper, which has not been extracted from the ore.

                    "content": "Chemistry  artefacts  recovered  from  Mitathal  in  Haryana  and  eight  other  sites distributed in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra prove that copper metallurgy in India dates back to the Chalcolithic cultures in the subcontinent. Indian chalcolithic copper objects were in all probability made indigenously. The ore for extraction of metal for making  the  objects  was  obtained  from  chalcopyrite  ore  deposits  in Aravalli Hills. Collection of archaeological texts from copper-plates and rock-inscriptions  have  been  compiled  and  published  by  the Archaeological Survey of India during the past century. Royal records were engraved on copper plates  (tamra-patra) . Earliest known copper- plate has a Mauryan record that mentions famine relief efforts. It has one of the very few pre-Ashoka Brahmi inscriptions in India. Harappans  also  used  gold  and  silver,  as  well  as  their  joint  alloy electrum. Variety of ornaments such as pendants, bangles, beads and rings have been found in ceramic or bronze pots. Early gold and silver ornaments  have  been  found  from  Indus  Valley  sites  such  as Mohenjodaro (3000 BCE). These are on display in the National Museum, New Delhi. India has the distinction of having the deepest ancient gold mines in the world, in the Maski region of Karnataka. Carbon dating places them in mid 1st millennium BCE.  Hymns  of  Rigveda   give  earliest  indirect  references  to  the  alluvial placer gold deposits in India. The river Sindhu was an important source of gold in ancient times. It is interesting that the availability of alluvial placer gold in the river Sindhu has been reported in modern times also. It has been reported that there are great mines of gold in the region of Mansarovar and in Thokjalyug even now. The  Pali  text,  Anguttara Nikaya  narrates the process of the recovery of gold dust or particles from alluvial placer gold deposits. Although evidence of gold refining is available in Vedic texts, it is Kautilya’s  Arthashastra , authored probably in 3rd or 4th  century  BCE,  during  Mauryan  era,  which  has  much  data  on prevailing chemical practices in a long section on mines and minerals including metal ores of gold, silver, copper, lead, tin and iron. Kautilya describes a variety of gold called  rasviddha , which is naturally occurring gold  solution.   Kalidas   also  mentioned  about  such  solutions.  It  is astonishing how people recognised such solutions. The native gold has different colours depending upon the nature and amount of impurity present in it. It is likely that the different colours of native gold were a major driving force for the development of gold refining. Recent excavations in central parts of Ganges Valley and Vindhya hills have shown that iron was produced there possibly as early as in 1800 BCE. In the recent excavations conducted by the Uttar Pradesh State Archaeological Department, iron furnaces, artefacts, tuyers and layers of slag have been found. Radiocarbon dating places them between BCE  1800  and  1000.  The  results  of  excavation  indicate  that  the knowledge  of  iron  smelting  and  manufacturing  of  iron  artefacts  was well  known  in  Eastern  Vindhyas  and  it  was  in  use  in  the  Central Ganga Plains, at least from the early 2nd millennium BCE. The quantity and  types  of  iron  artefacts  and  the  level  of  technical  advancements indicate that working of iron would have been introduced much earlier. 2022-23"

Iron  smelting  and  the  use  of  iron  was  especially  established  in South Indian megalithic cultures. The forging of wrought iron seems to have been at peak in India in the Ist millennium CE. Greek accounts report  the  manufacture  of  steel  in  India  by  crucible  process.  In  this process,  iron,  charcoal  and  glass  were  mixed  together  in  a  crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. India was a major innovator in the production of advanced quality steel. Indian steel was called ‘the Wonder Material of the Orient’. A Roman historian, Quintus  Curtius,  records  that  one  of  the  gifts  Porus  of  Taxila  (326 BCE)  gave  to  Alexander  the  Great  was  some  two-and-a-half  tons  of Wootz steel. Wootz steel is primarily iron containing a high proportion of carbon (1.0 – 1.9%). Wootz is the English version of the word  ‘ukku’  which  is  used  for  steel  in  Karnataka  and  Andhra  Pradesh.  Literary accounts  suggest  that  Indian  Wootz  steel  from  southern  part  of  the Indian subcontinent was exported to Europe, China and Arab world. It  became  prominent  in  the  Middle  East  where  it  was  named  as Damasus Steel. Michael Faraday tried to duplicate this steel by alloying iron with a variety of metals, including noble metals, but failed. When iron ore is reduced in solid state by using charcoal, porous iron blocks are formed. Therefore, reduced iron blocks are also called sponge  iron  blocks.  Any  useful  product  can  be  obtained  from  this material only after removing the porosity by hot forging. The iron so obtained is termed as wrought iron. An exciting example of wrought iron produced in ancient India is the world famous Iron Pillar. It was erected in its present position in Delhi in 5th century CE. The Sanskrit inscription  engraved  on  it  suggests  that  it  was  brought  here  from elsewhere during the Gupta Period. The average composition (weight%) of the components present in the wrought iron of the pillar, besides iron, are 0.15% C, 0.05% Si, 0.05% Mn, 0.25% P, 0.005% Ni, 0.03% Cu and 0.02% N. The most significant aspect of the pillar is that there is no sign of corrosion inspite of the fact that it has been exposed to the atmosphere for about 1,600 years. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from iron slag revealed evidence of continuous smelting in Khasi Hills of Meghalaya. The slag layer, which is dated to 353 BCE – CE 128, indicates that Khasi Hill region is the earliest iron smelting site studied in the entire region of North East  India.  The  remnants  of  former  iron-ore  excavation  and  iron manufacturing are visible even now in the landscape of Khasi Hills. British  naturalists  who  visited  Meghalaya  in  early  19th  century described the iron industry that had developed in the upper part of the Khasi Hills. There  is  archaeological  evidence  of  zinc  production  in  Rajasthan mines at Zawar from the 6th or 5th BCE. India was the first country to  master  zinc  distillation.  Due  to  low  boiling  point,  zinc  tends  to vapourise while its ore is smelted. Pure zinc could be produced after a sophisticated ‘downward’ distillation technique in which the vapour 2022-23"

This has been described in Sanskrit texts of 14th century. Indians  had  knowledge  about  mercury.  They  used  it  for  medicinal purpose. Development of mining and metallurgy declined during the British colonial era. By the 19th century, once flourished mines of Rajasthan were mostly  abandoned  and  became  almost  extinct.  In  1947  when  India  got independence, European literature on science had already found its way slowly into the country. Thus, in post independence era, the Government of India initiated the process of nation building through the establishment of various institutes of science and technology. In the following sections, we will learn about the modern methods of extraction of elements. A few elements like carbon, sulphur, gold and noble gases, occur in free state  while  others  are  found  in  combined  forms  in  the  earth’s  crust. Elements  vary  in  abundance.  Among  metals,  aluminium  is  the  most abundant. In fact, it is the third most abundant element in earth’s crust (8.3%  approx.  by  weight).  It  is  a  major  component  of  many  igneous minerals including mica and clays. Many gemstones are impure forms of  Al 2 O 3 .  For  example,  gems  ‘ruby’  and  ‘sapphire’  have  Cr  and  Co respectively as impurity. Iron is the second most abundant metal in the earth’s crust. It forms a variety of compounds and their various uses make it a very important element. It is one of the essential elements in biological systems as well. For obtaining a particular metal, first we look for  minerals  which are naturally occurring chemical substances in the earth’s crust and are obtained through mining. Out of many minerals in which a metal may be found, only a few are viable to be used as source of that metal. Such minerals are known as  ores . The principal ores of aluminium, iron, copper and zinc are given in  Table  6.1.  6 . 16 . 1  6 . 1 6 . 1 6 . 1  Occurrence  ofOccurrence  ofOccurrence  ofOccurrence  ofOccurrence  of MetalsMetalsMetalsMetalsMetals  Aluminium   Bauxite   AlO x (OH) 3-2x  [where 0 < x < 1] Kaolinite  (a  form  of  clay)   [Al 2  (OH) 4  Si 2 O 5 ] Iron   Haematite   Fe 2 O 3  Magnetite   Fe 3 O 4  Siderite   FeCO 3  Iron  pyrites   FeS 2  Copper   Copper  pyrites   CuFeS 2  Malachite   CuCO 3 .Cu(OH) 2  Cuprite   Cu 2 O Copper  glance   Cu 2 S Zinc   Zinc  blende  or  Sphalerite   ZnS Calamine   ZnCO 3  Zincite   ZnO  Metal   Ores   Composition  Table  6.1:  Principal  Ores  of  Some  Important  Metals  A  particular  element  may  occur  in  a  variety  of  compounds.

                    "content": "General  Principles  and  Processes  of  Isolation  of  Elements 153  For the purpose of extraction, bauxite is chosen for aluminium. For iron, usually the oxide ores which are abundant and do not produce polluting  gases  (like  SO 2   that  is  produced  in  case  of  iron  pyrites)  are taken. For copper and zinc, any of the ores listed in Table 6.1 may be used depending upon the availability and other relevant factors. The entire scientific and technological process used for isolation of the  metal  from  its  ore  is  known  as   metallurgy .  The  extraction  and isolation  of  an  element  from  its  combined  form  involves  various principles of chemistry. Still, some general principles are common to all the extraction processes of metals. An  ore  rarely  contains  only  a  desired  substance.  It  is  usually contaminated with earthly or undesired materials known as  gangue . The extraction and isolation of metals from ores involves the following major steps: •   Concentration of the ore, •   Isolation of the metal from its concentrated ore, and •   Purification of the metal. In the following Sections, we shall first describe the various steps for effective concentration of ores. After that principles of some of the common  metallurgical  processes  will  be  discussed.  Those  principles will include the thermodynamic and electrochemical aspects involved in the effective reduction of the concentrated ore to the metal. Removal of the unwanted materials (e.g., sand, clays, etc.) from the ore is known as  concentration ,  dressing  or  benefaction . Before proceeding for  concentration,  ores  are  graded  and  crushed  to  reasonable  size. Concentration of ores involves several steps and selection of these steps depends upon the differences in physical properties of the compound of the  metal  present  and  that  of  the   gangue.   The  type  of  the  metal,  the available  facilities  and  the  environmental  factors  are  also  taken  into consideration. Some of the important procedures for concentration of ore are described below. This is based on the difference between specific gravities of the ore and the  gangue  particles. It is therefore a type of  gravity separation . In one such process, an upward stream of running water is used to wash the powdered ore. The lighter gangue particles are washed away and the heavier ore particles are left behind. This  is  based  on  differences  in  magnetic  properties  of  the  ore components.  If  either  the  ore  or  the  gangue  is  attracted  towards magnetic  field,  then  the  separation  is carried out by this method. For example iron ores are attracted towards magnet, hence, non–magnetic impurities can be separted  from  them  using  magnetic separation.  The  powdered  ore  is dropped  over  a  conveyer  belt  which moves  over  a  magnetic  roller  (Fig.6.1) Magnetic substance remains attracted towards the belt and falls close to it.  6.2.1   Hydraulic Washing 6.2.2   Magnetic Separation  6 . 26 . 2  6 . 26 . 2 6 . 2  ConcentrationConcentrationConcentrationConcentrationConcentration of  Oresof  Ores of  Oresof  Oresof  Ores  Fig. 6.1:   Magnetic separation (schematic) 2022-23"

                    "content": "Chemistry  This method is used for removing gangue from sulphide ores. In this process,  a  suspension  of  the  powdered  ore  is  made  with  water.  Collectors   and   froth stabilisers   are  added  to it.  Collectors  (e.g.,  pine oils, fatty acids, xanthates, etc.)  enhance  non- wettability of the mineral particles  and  froth stabilisers  (e.g.,  cresols, aniline) stabilise the froth. The  mineral  particles become wet by oils while the  gangue  particles  by water.  A  rotating  paddle agitates  the  mixture  and draws  air  in  it.  As  a result,  froth  is  formed which carries the mineral particles. The froth is light and is skimmed off. It is then dried for recovery of the ore particles. Sometimes,  it  is  possible  to  separate  two  sulphide  ores  by adjusting  proportion  of  oil  to  water  or  by  using  ‘ depressants ’. For  example,  in  the  case  of  an  ore  containing  ZnS  and  PbS,  the depressant  used  is  NaCN.  It  selectively  prevents  ZnS  from  coming to the froth but allows PbS to come with the froth. Leaching is often used if the ore is soluble in some suitable solvent. Following examples illustrate the procedure:  (a)   Leaching of alumina from bauxite  Bauxite  is  the  principal  ore  of  aluminium.  It  usually  contains  SiO 2 , iron oxides and titanium oxide (TiO 2 ) as impurities. Concentration is carried out by heating the powdered ore with a concentrated solution of  NaOH  at  473  –  523  K  and  35  –  36  bar  pressure.  This  process  is called digestion. This way, Al 2 O 3  is extracted out as sodium aluminate.  6.2.4   Leaching  Fig. 6.2:   Froth floatation process  6.2.3   Froth Floatation Method  The  Innovative  WasherwomanThe  Innovative  WasherwomanThe  Innovative  WasherwomanThe  Innovative  WasherwomanThe  Innovative  Washerwoman  One  can  do  wonders  if  he  or  she  has  a  scientific  temperament  and  is  attentive  to observations.  A  washerwoman  had  an  innovative  mind  too.  While  washing  a  miner’s overalls,  she  noticed  that  sand  and  similar  dirt  fell  to  the  bottom  of  the  washtub.  What was peculiar, the copper bearing compounds that had come to the clothes from the mines, were caught in the soapsuds and so they came to the top. One of her clients, Mrs. Carrie Everson  was  a  chemist.  The  washerwoman  told  her  experience  to  Mrs.  Everson.  The latter  thought  that  the  idea  could  be  used  for  separating  copper  compounds  from  rocky and  earth  materials  on  large  scale.  This  way  an  invention  came  up.  At  that  time  only those ores were used for extraction of copper, which contained large amounts of the metal. Invention of the  Froth Floatation Method  made copper mining profitable even from the low- grade  ores.  World  production  of  copper  soared  and  the  metal  became  cheaper. 2022-23"

(b) Reduction of oxide to the metal  Reduction  of  the  metal  oxide  usually involves heating it with a reducing agent, for example C, or CO or even another metal. The  reducing  agent  (e.g.,  carbon)  combines  with  the  oxygen  of  the metal oxide. M x O y   +  yC   →   xM  +  y  CO   (6.13) Some metal oxides get reduced easily while others are very difficult to be reduced (reduction means electron gain by the metal ion). In any case, heating is required. Some basic concepts of thermodynamics help us in understanding the theory  of  metallurgical  transformations.  Gibbs  energy  is  the  most significant term. To understand the variation in the temperature required for thermal reductions and to predict which element will suit as the reducing  agent  for  a  given  metal  oxide  (M x O y ),  Gibbs  energy interpretations are made. The criterion for the feasibility of a thermal reduction  is  that  at  a  given  temperture  Gibbs  energy  change  of  the reaction  must  be  negative.  The  change  in  Gibbs  energy,   ∆ G   for  any process at any specified temperature, is described by the equation:  ∆ G   =   ∆ H   –   T ∆ S   (6.14) where,  ∆ H  is the enthalpy change and  ∆ S  is the entropy change for the process. When  the  value  of   ∆ G   is  negative  in  equation  6.14,  only  then  the reaction will proceed.  ∆ G  can become negative in the following situations: 1.   If  ∆ S  is positive, on increasing the temperature ( T ), the value of  T ∆ S  increases so that  ∆ H  <  T ∆ S . In this situation  ∆ G  will become negative on increasing temperature. 2.   If  coupling  of  the  two  reactions,  i.e.  reduction  and  oxidation, results  in  negative  value  of   ∆ G   for  overall  reaction,  the  final reaction becomes feasible. Such coupling is easily understood  6 . 46 . 4  6 . 46 . 4 6 . 4  ThermodynamicThermodynamicThermodynamicThermodynamicThermodynamic Principles  ofPrinciples  of Principles  ofPrinciples  ofPrinciples  of MetallurgyMetallurgyMetallurgyMetallurgyMetallurgy  Fig. 6.3:   A section of a modern reverberatory  furnace  *   During  metallurgy,  ‘flux’  is  added  which  combines  with  ‘gangue’  to  form  ‘slag’.

These plots are drawn for free energy changes that occur when one gram mole of oxygen is consumed. The graphical representation of Gibbs energy was first used by H.J.T. Ellingham. This provides a sound basis for considering the choice of reducing agent in the reduction of oxides. This is known as  Ellingham Diagram . Such diagrams help us in predicting the feasibility of thermal reduction of an ore. As  we  know,  during  reduction,  the  oxide  of  a  metal  decomposes and the reducing agent takes away the oxygen. The role of reducing agent is to provide  ∆ r G V   negative and large enough to make the sum of  ∆ r G V      of the two reactions, i.e, oxidation of the reducing agent and reduction of the metal oxide negative.

Subsequently   ∆ f G V   shifts  towards higher  side  despite  rising   T.   The  result  is  positive  slope  in  the  curve  for  most  of  the reactions  for  the  formation  of  M x O(s). (b)   Each  plot  is  a  straight  line  and  slopes  upwards  except  when  some  change  in  phase (s →    l  or  l →    g)  takes  place.  The  temperature  at  which  such  change  occurs,  is  indicated by  an  increase  in  the  slope  on  positive  side  (e.g.,  in  the  Zn,  ZnO  plot,  the  melting  is indicated  by  an  abrupt  change  in  the  curve)  [Fig.  6.4]. (c)   When  temperature  is  raised,  a  point  is  reached  in  the  curve  where  it  crosses   ∆ r G V =0 line. Below this temperature,  ∆ r G V   for the formation of oxide is negative so M x O is stable. Above  this  point,  free  energy  of  formation  of  oxide  is  positive.  The  oxide,  M x O  will decompose  on  its  own. (d)   Similar  diagrams  are  constructed  for  sulfides  and  halides  also.  From  them  it  becomes clear  that  why  reduction  of  M x S  is  difficult.  Limitations  of  Ellingham  Diagram 1.   The  graph  simply  indicates  whether  a  reaction  is  possible  or  not,  i.e.,  the  tendency  of reduction with a reducing agent is indicated. This is so because it is based only on the thermodynamic  concepts.  It  does  not  explain  the  kinetics  of  the  reduction  process.  It cannot  answer  questions  like  how  fast  reduction  can  proceed?  However, it explains why the  reactions  are  sluggish  when  every  species  is  in  solid  state  and  smooth  when  the  ore melts  down.  It  is  interesting  to  note  here  that   ∆ H   (enthalpy  change)  and  the   ∆ S   (entropy change)  values  for  any  chemical  reaction  remain  nearly  constant  even  on  varying temperature.  So  the  only  dominant  variable  in  equation(6.14)  becomes   T .  However,   ∆ S  depends much on the physical state of the compound. Since entropy depends on disorder or  randomness  in  the  system,  it  will  increase  if  a  compound  melts  (s →    l )  or  vapourises ( l →   g) since molecular randomness increases on changing the phase from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. 2.   The interpretation of  ∆ r G V     is based on  K  ( ∆ G V  = – R T  ln K ). Thus it is presumed that the reactants  and  products  are  in  equilibrium: M x O + A red   l  xM + A red O       This is not always true because the reactant/product may be solid. In commercial processes      reactants and products are in contact for a short time. 2022-23"

The   ∆ r G 0    values  for these  reactions  in  general,  can  be  obtained  from  the  corresponding  ∆ f   G 0    values  of  oxides. As we have seen, heating (i.e., increasing  T ) favours a negative value of  ∆ r G 0 . Therefore, the temperature is chosen such that the sum of  ∆ r G 0  in  the  two  combined  redox  processes  is  negative.  In   ∆ r G 0    vs  T  plots (Ellingham diagram, Fig. 6.4), this is indicated by the point of intersection of the two curves, i.e, the curve for the formation of M x O and that for the formation of the oxide of the reducing substance. After that  point,  the   ∆ r G 0   value  becomes  more  negative  for  the  combined process  making  the  reduction  of  M x O  possible.  The  difference  in  the two  ∆ r G 0   values after that point determines whether reduction of the oxide  of  the  element  of  the  upper  line  is  feasible  by  the  element  of which oxide formation is represented by the lower line. If the difference is large, the reduction is easier.  (a)   Extraction of iron from its oxides  After concentration, mixture of oxide ores of iron (Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 3 O 4 ) is subjected to  calcination / roasting  to remove water, to decompose carbonates and to oxidise sulphides. After that these are mixed with limestone  and  coke  and  fed  into  a   Blast  furnace   from  its  top,  in which  the  oxide  is  reduced  to  the  metal.  In  the  Blast  furnace,  6.4.1 Applications  Suggest a condition under which magnesium could reduce alumina. The two equations are: (a)   4  3   Al  +  O 2   →      2 3   Al 2 O 3   (b)   2Mg  +O 2   →   2MgO At the point of intersection of the Al 2 O 3  and MgO curves (marked “A” in diagram 6.4), the  ∆ r G 0  becomes ZERO for the reaction: 2 3   Al 2 O 3   +2Mg   →   2MgO  +   4 3   Al Below that point magnesium can reduce alumina. Although thermodynamically feasible, in practice, magnesium metal is not used for the reduction of alumina in the metallurgy of aluminium. Why ? Temperatures below the point of intersection of Al 2 O 3  and MgO curves, magnesium can reduce alumina. But the process will be uneconomical. Why is the reduction of a metal oxide easier if the metal formed is in liquid state at the temperature of reduction? The entropy is higher if the metal is in liquid state than when it is in solid state. The value of entropy change ( ∆ S ) of the reduction process is more on positive side when the metal formed is in liquid state and the metal oxide being reduced is in solid state. Thus the value of  ∆ r G V  becomes more on negative side and the reduction becomes easier.

A blast of hot air is  blown  from  the  bottom  of  the  furnace  by burning  coke  in  the  lower  portion  to  give temperature upto about 2200K. The burning of coke,  therefore,  supplies  most  of  the  heat required in the process. The CO and heat move to the upper part of the furnace. In upper part, the  temperature  is  lower  and  the  iron  oxides (Fe 2 O 3   and  Fe 3 O 4 )  coming  from  the  top  are reduced in steps to FeO. These reactions can be summarised as  follows: At 500 – 800 K (lower temperature range in the blast furnace), Fe 2 O 3   is  first  reduced  to  Fe 3 O 4   and  then to FeO 3 Fe 2 O 3  + CO  →  2 Fe 3 O 4  + CO 2   (6.22) Fe 3 O 4   +  4  CO   →   3Fe  +  4  CO 2   (6.23) Fe 2 O 3  + CO  →  2FeO + CO 2   (6.24) Limestone  is  also  decomposed  to  CaO  which removes silicate impurity of the ore as slag. The slag is in molten state and separates out from iron. At 900 – 1500 K (higher temperature range in the blast furnace): C + CO 2   →  2 CO   (6.25) FeO + CO  →  Fe + CO 2   (6.26) Thermodynamics helps us to understand how coke reduces the oxide and why this furnace is chosen. One of the main reduction steps in this process involves reaction 6.27 given below. FeO(s) + C(s)  →  Fe(s/l) + CO (g)   (6.27) This  reaction  can  be  seen  as  a  reaction  in  which  two  simpler reactions  have  coupled.  In  one  the  reduction  of  FeO  is  taking  place and in the other, C is being oxidised to CO: FeO(s)  →  Fe(s) +    1 2   O 2 (g)   (6.28) C(s) +    1 2   O 2  (g)  →  CO (g)   (6.29) When both the reactions take place to yield the equation (6.27), the net Gibbs energy change becomes:  ∆ r G 0    (C,  CO)   +   ∆ r G 0        (FeO,  Fe)   =   ∆ r G 0   (6.30) Naturally, the resultant reaction will take place when the right hand side  in  equation  6.30  is  negative.  In   ∆ r G 0       vs   T   plot  representing  the change  Fe →   FeO  in  Fig.  6.4  goes  upward  and  that  representing  the change C →  CO (C,CO) goes downward.

At temperatures above 1073K (approx.), the C, CO line is below the  Fe,  FeO  line      <   .  So  above  1073  K  in  the  range  of temprature 900–1500 K coke will reduce FeO and will itself be oxidised to CO. Let us try to understand this through Fig. 6.4 (approximate values of  ∆ r G 0     are given). At about 1673K (1400 o C)  ∆ r G 0    value for the reaction: 2FeO →    2Fe+O 2   is  +341  kJmol -1   because  it  is  reverse  of  Fe →    FeO change and for the reaction 2C+O 2 →   2CO  ∆ r G 0     is -447 kJmol -1 . If we calculate  ∆ r G 0     value for overall reaction (6.27 the value will be -53 kJmol -1 ). Therefore, reaction 6.27  becomes  feasible.  In  a  similar  way  the  reduction  of  Fe 3 O 4   and Fe 2 O 3  by CO  at relatively lower temperatures can be explained on the basis of lower lying points of intersection of their curves with the CO, CO 2  curve. The  iron  obtained  from  Blast  furnace  contains  about  4%  carbon and  many  impurities  in  smaller  amount  (e.g.,  S,  P,  Si,  Mn).  This  is known as  pig iron .  It can be moulded into variety of shapes.  Cast iron  is different from  pig iron  and is made by melting pig iron with scrap iron and coke using hot air blast. It has slightly lower carbon content (about 3%) and is extremely hard and brittle.  Further  Reductions  Wrought iron  or malleable iron is the purest form of commercial iron and is prepared from cast iron by oxidising impurities in a reverberatory furnace lined with haematite. The haematite oxidises carbon to carbon monoxide: Fe 2 O 3   +  3  C   →   2  Fe  +  3  CO   (6.31) Limestone is added as a flux and sulphur, silicon and phosphorus are oxidised and passed into the slag. The metal is removed and freed from the slag by passing through rollers.  (b)   Extraction  of  copper  from  cuprous  oxide  [copper(I)  oxide]  In the graph of  ∆ r G 0     vs T for the formation of oxides (Fig. 6.4), the Cu 2 O line is almost at the top. So it is quite easy to reduce oxide ores of copper directly  to  the  metal  by  heating  with  coke.  The  lines  (C,  CO)  and (C,  CO 2 )  are  at  much  lower  positions  in  the  graph  particularly  after 500 – 600K. However, many  of the ores are sulphides and some may also contain iron. The sulphide ores are roasted/smelted to give oxides: 2Cu 2 S  +  3O 2    →      2Cu 2 O  +  2SO 2   (6.32) The oxide can then be easily reduced to metallic copper using coke: Cu 2 O  +  C   →      2  Cu  +  CO   (6.33) In actual process, the ore is heated in a reverberatory furnace after mixing with silica. In the furnace, iron oxide ‘slags of’ as iron slicate is formed. Copper is produced in the form of  copper matte . This contains Cu 2 S and FeS.

The fused matrix is electrolysed. Steel  vessel  with  lining  of  carbon  acts  as cathode  and  graphite  anode  is  used.  The overall reaction may be written as: 2Al 2 O 3   +  3C   →   4Al  +  3CO 2     (6.42) This  process  of  electrolysis  is  widely known as  Hall-Heroult process . Thus electrolysis of the molten mass  is carried  out  in  an  electrolytic  cell  using carbon electrodes. The oxygen liberated at anode  reacts  with  the  carbon  of  anode producing CO and CO 2 .

When it is converted to E 0  (using  ∆ G 0  = – nE 0 F), we get E 0  = – 2.2 V. Naturally, it will require an external emf that is greater than 2.2 V. But the electrolysis requires an excess potential to overcome some other hindering reactions (Unit–3, Section 3.5.1). Thus, Cl 2  is obtained by electrolysis giving out H 2  and aqueous  NaOH  as  by-products.  Electrolysis  of  molten  NaCl  is  also carried out. But in that case, Na metal is produced and not NaOH.  6 . 66 . 6  6 . 66 . 6 6 . 6  OxidationOxidation OxidationOxidationOxidation ReductionReduction ReductionReductionReduction  Fig. 6.6:   Electrolytic cell for the extraction  of  aluminium  At a site, low grade copper ores are available and zinc and iron scraps are also available. Which of the two scraps would be more suitable for reducing the leached copper ore and why? Zinc being above iron in the electrochemical series (more reactive metal is zinc), the reduction will be faster in case zinc scraps are used. But zinc is costlier metal than iron so using iron scraps will be advisable and advantageous.

                    "content": "Chemistry  As studied earlier, extraction of gold and silver involves leaching the metal with CN – . This is also an oxidation reaction (Ag  →  Ag +  or Au  →  Au + ).

A metal extracted by any method is usually contaminated with some impurity. For obtaining metals of high purity, several techniques are used depending upon the differences in properties of the metal and the impurity. Some of them are listed below.  (a)   Distillation   (b)   Liquation  (c)   Electrolysis   (d)   Zone refining  (e)   Vapour phase refining   (f )   Chromatographic methods These are described in detail here.  (a)   Distillation  This  is  very  useful  for  low  boiling  metals  like  zinc  and  mercury. The impure metal is evaporated to obtain the pure metal as distillate.  (b)   Liquation  In this method a low melting metal like tin can be made to flow on a sloping surface. In this way it is separated from higher melting impurities.  (c)   Electrolytic  refining  In this method, the impure metal is made to act as anode. A strip of the same metal in pure form is used as cathode. They are put in a suitable electrolytic bath containing soluble salt of the same metal. The more basic metal remains in the solution and the less basic ones  go to the anode mud. This process is also explained using the concept of electrode potential, over potential, and Gibbs energy which you have seen in previous sections. The reactions are: Anode:   M  →  M n+  + ne –  Cathode:   M n+  + ne –   →  M   (6.50)  Copper  is refined using an electrolytic method. Anodes are of impure copper and pure copper strips are taken as cathode. The electrolyte is acidified solution of copper sulphate and the net result of electrolysis is the transfer of copper in pure form from the anode to the cathode: Anode:   Cu   →   Cu 2+   +  2  e –  Cathode:   Cu 2+   +  2e –    →    Cu   (6.51) Impurities from the blister copper deposit as anode mud which contains antimony, selenium, tellurium, silver, gold and platinum; recovery of these elements may meet the cost of refining. Zinc may also be refined this way.  6 . 76 . 7  6 . 7 6 . 7 6 . 7  RefiningRefiningRefiningRefiningRefining 2022-23"

A mobile heater surrounding  the  rod  of  impure  metal  is  fixed  at  its  one  end (Fig.  6.7).  The  molten  zone  moves  along  with  the  heater  which  is moved forward. As the heater moves forward, the pure metal crystallises out of the melt left behind and the impurities pass  on  into  the  adjacent  new  molten  zone created by movement of heaters. The process is  repeated  several  times  and  the  heater  is moved in the same direction again and again. Impurities get concentrated  at one end. This end is cut off. This method is very useful for producing semiconductor and other metals of very  high  purity,  e.g.,  germanium,  silicon, boron, gallium and indium.  (e)   Vapour  phase  refining  In this method, the metal is converted into its volatile compound which is collected and decomposed to give pure metal. So, the two requirements are: (i)   the  metal  should  form  a  volatile  compound  with  an  available reagent, (ii)   the volatile compound should be easily decomposable, so that the recovery is easy. Following examples will illustrate this technique.  Mond Process for Refining Nickel:  In this process, nickel is heated in a stream of carbon monoxide forming a volatile complex named as nickel tetracarbonyl. This compex is decomposed at higher temperature to obtain pure metal.

The  crude  metal  is heated  in  an  evacuated  vessel  with  iodine.  The  metal  iodide  being more  covalent,  volatilises:  Zr  +  2I 2   →   ZrI 4   (6.54) The metal iodide is decomposed on a tungsten filament, electrically heated to about 1800K. The pure metal deposits on the filament.

For over 7000 years, India has had high tradition of metallurigical skills. Ancient Indian metallurgists have made major contributions which  deserve  their  place  in  metallurgical  history  of  the  world.  In  the  case  of  zinc and  high–carbon  steel,  ancient  India  contributed  significantly  for  the  developemnt of  base  for  the  modern  metallurgical  advancements  which  induced  metallurgical study  leading  to  Industrial  Revolution. Metals are required for a variety of purposes. For this, we need their extraction from the  minerals  in  which  they  are  present  and  from  which  their  extraction  is commercially  feasible.These  minerals  are  known  as   ores .  Ores  of  the  metal  are associated  with  many  impurities.  Removal  of  these  impurities  to  certain  extent  is achieved  in   concentration   steps.  The  concentrated  ore  is  then  treated  chemically for  obtaining  the  metal.  Usually  the  metal  compounds  (e.g.,  oxides,  sulphides)  are reduced to the metal. The reducing agents used are carbon, CO or even some metals.  Column  chromatography   is  very  useful  for  purification  of  the elements which are available in minute quantities and the impurities are not very different in chemical properties from the element to be purified. Aluminium foils are used as wrappers for food materials. The fine dust of the metal is used in paints and lacquers. Aluminium, being highly  reactive,  is  also  used  in  the  extraction  of  chromium  and manganese  from  their  oxides.  Wires  of  aluminium  are  used  as electricity  conductors.  Alloys  containing  aluminium,  being  light, are very useful. Copper is used for making wires used in electrical industry and for water and steam pipes. It is also used in several alloys that are rather tougher than the metal itself, e.g., brass (with zinc), bronze (with tin) and coinage alloy (with nickel). Zinc is used for galvanising iron. It is also used in large quantities in batteries. It is constituent of many alloys, e.g., brass, (Cu 60%, Zn 40%)  and  german  silver  (Cu  25-30%,  Zn  25-30%,  Ni  40–50%).  Zinc dust  is  used  as  a  reducing  agent  in  the  manufacture  of  dye-stuffs, paints, etc. Cast  iron,  which  is  the  most  important  form  of  iron,  is  used  for casting stoves, railway sleepers, gutter pipes , toys, etc. It is used in the manufacture  of  wrought  iron  and  steel.   Wrought  iron   is  used  in making anchors, wires, bolts, chains and agricultural implements. Steel finds a number of uses. Alloy steel is obtained when other metals are added  to  it.  Nickel  steel  is  used  for  making  cables,  automobiles  and aeroplane parts, pendulum, measuring tapes. Chrome steel is used for cutting  tools  and  crushing  machines,  and  stainless  steel  is  used  for cycles, automobiles, utensils, pens, etc.  6 . 86 . 8  6 . 8 6 . 8 6 . 8  Uses  ofUses  ofUses  ofUses  ofUses  of Aluminium,Aluminium, Aluminium,Aluminium,Aluminium, CopperCopper CopperCopperCopper,  Zinc,  Zinc ,  Zinc,  Zinc,  Zinc and  Ironand  Iron and  Ironand  Ironand  Iron 2022-23"

The  metal  oxide  reacts  with  a  reducing  agent;  the oxide is reduced to the metal and the reducing agent is oxidised. In the two reactions, the  net  Gibbs  energy  change  is  negative,  which  becomes  more  negative  on  raising the  temperature.  Conversion  of  the  physical  states  from  solid  to  liquid  or  to  gas, and formation of gaseous states favours decrease in the Gibbs energy for the entire system. This concept is graphically displayed in plots of  ∆ G 0  vs T (Ellingham diagram) for  such  oxidation/reduction  reactions  at  different  temperatures.  The  concept  of electrode  potential  is  useful  in  the  isolation  of  metals  (e.g.,  Al,  Ag,  Au)  where  the sum of the two redox couples is positive so that the Gibbs energy change is negative. The  metals  obtained  by  usual  methods  still  contain  minor  impurities.  Getting  pure metals  requires   refining .    Refining  process  depends  upon  the  differences  in properties of the metal and the impurities. Extraction of aluminium is usually carried out from its bauxite ore by leaching it with NaOH. Sodium aluminate, thus formed, is  separated  and  then  neutralised  to  give  back  the  hydrated  oxide,  which  is  then electrolysed  using  cryolite  as  a  flux.  Extraction  of  iron  is  done  by  reduction  of  its oxide  ore  in  blast  furnace.  Copper  is  extracted  by  smelting  and  heating  in  a reverberatory furnace. Extraction of zinc from zinc oxides is done using coke. Several methods  are  employed  in  refining  the  metal.  Metals,  in  general,  are  very  widely used and have contributed significantly in the development of a variety of industries.

The properties of   p -block  elements  like  that  of  others  are  greatly influenced by atomic sizes, ionisation enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity. The absence of  d - orbitals in second period and presence of  d  or  d  and  f  orbitals in heavier elements (starting from third period onwards)  have  significant  effects  on  the  properties  of elements.

Trends of some of the atomic, physical and chemical properties of the group  are  discussed  below. The valence shell electronic configuration of these elements is  ns 2 np 3 . The  s  orbital in these elements is completely filled and  p  orbitals are half-filled, making their electronic configuration extra stable. Covalent  and  ionic  (in  a  particular  state)  radii  increase  in  size down the group. There is a considerable increase in covalent radius from  N  to  P.  However,  from  As  to  Bi  only  a  small  increase  in covalent  radius  is  observed.  This  is  due  to  the  presence  of completely  filled   d  and/or   f   orbitals  in  heavier  members. Ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group due to gradual increase in atomic size. Because of the extra stable half-filled  p  orbitals electronic configuration and smaller size, the ionisation enthalpy of the group 15 elements  is  much  greater  than  that  of  group  14  elements  in  the corresponding periods.

Metallic character increases down the group. Nitrogen and phosphorus are non-metals, arsenic and antimony metalloids and bismuth is a metal. This is due to decrease in ionisation enthalpy and increase in atomic size. The boiling points, in general, increase from top to bottom in the group but the melting point increases upto arsenic and then decreases upto bismuth. Except nitrogen, all the elements show allotropy.  Oxidation  states  and  trends  in  chemical  reactivity  The  common  oxidation  states  of  these  elements  are  –3,  +3  and  +5. The tendency to exhibit –3 oxidation state decreases down the group due to increase in size and metallic character. In fact last member of the group, bismuth hardly forms any compound in –3 oxidation state. The stability of +5 oxidation state decreases down the group. The only well characterised Bi (V) compound is BiF 5 . The stability of +5 oxidation state decreases and that of +3 state increases (due to inert pair effect) down the group. Besides +5 oxidation state, nitrogen exhibits + 1, + 2, + 4 oxidation states also when it reacts with oxygen.  However,  it  does  not  form  compounds  in +5 oxidation state with halogens as nitrogen does not have  d -orbitals to  accommodate  electrons  from  other  elements  to  form  bonds. Phosphorus also shows +1 and +4 oxidation states in some oxoacids. In the case of nitrogen, all oxidation states from +1 to +4 tend to disproportionate in acid solution. For example, 3HNO 2  →  HNO 3  + H 2 O + 2NO Similarly, in case of phosphorus nearly all intermediate oxidation states disproportionate into +5 and –3 both in alkali and acid. However +3 oxidation state in case of arsenic, antimony and bismuth becomes increasingly stable with respect to disproportionation. Nitrogen is restricted to a maximum covalency of 4 since only four (one  s  and three  p ) orbitals are available for bonding. The heavier elements have vacant  d  orbitals in the outermost shell which can be used for bonding (covalency) and hence, expand their covalence as in PF – 6 .  Anomalous  properties  of  nitrogen  Nitrogen differs from the rest of the members of this group due to its  small  size,  high  electronegativity,  high  ionisation  enthalpy  and non-availability  of   d   orbitals.  Nitrogen  has  unique  ability  to  form  p ππ ππ π  - p πππππ   multiple   bonds  with  itself  and  with  other  elements  having small size and high electronegativity (e.g., C, O). Heavier elements of this group do not form  p π  - p π  bonds as their atomic orbitals are so large  and  diffuse  that  they  cannot  have  effective  overlapping. Thus, nitrogen exists as a diatomic molecule with a triple bond (one  s  and two  p ) between the two atoms. Consequently, its bond enthalpy (941.4 kJ mol –1 ) is very high. On the contrary, phosphorus, arsenic and  antimony  form  single  bonds  as  P–P,  As–As  and  Sb–Sb  while bismuth forms metallic bonds in elemental state. However, the single  7.1.5 Electronegativity 7.1.6   Physical  Properties 7.1.7   Chemical Properties 2022-23"

                    "content": "The   p -Block  Elements  N–N  bond  is  weaker  than  the  single  P–P  bond  because  of  high interelectronic repulsion of the non-bonding electrons, owing to the small bond length. As a result the catenation tendency is weaker in nitrogen. Another factor which affects the chemistry of nitrogen is the absence of  d  orbitals in its valence shell. Besides restricting its covalency to four, nitrogen cannot form  d ππ ππ π  – p ππ ππ π   bond  as the heavier elements can e.g., R 3 P = O or R 3 P = CH 2  (R = alkyl group). Phosphorus and arsenic can form  d ππ ππ π  – d πππππ  bond  also with transition metals when their compounds like P(C 2 H 5 ) 3  and As(C 6 H 5 ) 3  act as ligands. (i)   Reactivity  towards  hydrogen :  All  the  elements  of  Group  15 form  hydrides  of  the  type  EH 3   where  E  =  N,  P,  As,  Sb  or  Bi. Some  of  the  properties  of  these  hydrides  are  shown  in  Table 7.2.  The  hydrides  show  regular  gradation  in  their  properties. The stability of hydrides decreases from NH 3  to BiH 3  which can be  observed  from  their  bond  dissociation  enthalpy. Consequently, the reducing character of the hydrides increases. Ammonia  is  only  a  mild  reducing  agent  while  BiH 3   is  the strongest reducing agent amongst all the hydrides. Basicity also decreases in the order NH 3  > PH 3  > AsH 3  > SbH 3   > BiH 3 . Due to high  electronegativity  and  small  size  of  nitrogen,  NH 3   exhibits hydrogen bonding in solid as well as liquid state. Because of this, it has higher melting and boiling points than that of PH 3 . (ii)   Reactivity  towards  oxygen :  All  these  elements  form  two  types of oxides: E 2 O 3  and E 2 O 5 . The oxide in the higher oxidation state of the element is more acidic than that of lower oxidation state. Their acidic character decreases down the group. The oxides of the  type  E 2 O 3   of  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  are  purely  acidic, that of arsenic and antimony amphoteric and those of bismuth predominantly basic. (iii)   Reactivity  towards  halogens :  These  elements  react  to  form  two series of halides: EX 3  and EX 5 . Nitrogen does not form pentahalide due  to  non-availability  of  the   d   orbitals  in  its  valence  shell. Pentahalides are more covalent than trihalides. This is due to the fact that in pentahalides +5 oxidation state exists while in the case of trihalides +3 oxidation state exists.

Other  major  uses  are  in  the   pickling  of  stainless  steel,  etching of metals and as an oxidiser in rocket fuels. Phosphorus  is  found  in  many  allotropic  forms,  the  important  ones being white, red and black.  White phosphorus  is a translucent white waxy solid.

Red phosphorus  is obtained by heating white phosphorus at 573K in an inert atmosphere for several days. When red phosphorus is heated under high pressure, a series of phases of black phosphorus is formed. Red  phosphorus  possesses  iron  grey  lustre.  It  is  odourless,  non- poisonous  and  insoluble  in  water  as  well  as  in  carbon  disulphide. Chemically,  red  phosphorus  is  much  less  reactive  than  white phosphorus.

It is due to increase in size. However, the elements of this group have lower ionisation enthalpy values  compared  to  those  of  Group15  in  the  corresponding  periods. This is due to the fact that Group 15 elements have extra stable half- filled  p  orbitals electronic configurations. Because  of  the  compact  nature  of  oxygen  atom,  it  has  less  negative electron gain enthalpy than sulphur. However, from sulphur onwards the value again becomes less negative upto polonium. Next to fluorine, oxygen has the highest electronegativity value amongst the  elements.  Within  the  group,  electronegativity  decreases  with  an increase  in  atomic  number.  This  implies  that  the  metallic  character increases from oxygen to polonium. Some  of  the  physical  properties  of  Group  16  elements  are  given  in Table 7.6. Oxygen and sulphur are non-metals, selenium and tellurium metalloids, whereas polonium is a metal. Polonium is radioactive and is short lived (Half-life 13.8 days). All these elements exhibit allotropy. The  melting  and  boiling  points  increase  with  an  increase  in  atomic number down the group. The large difference between the melting and boiling points of oxygen and sulphur may be explained on the basis of  their  atomicity;  oxygen  exists  as  diatomic  molecule  (O 2 )  whereas sulphur exists as polyatomic molecule (S 8 ).  Oxidation  states  and  trends  in  chemical  reactivity  The elements of Group 16 exhibit a number of oxidation states (Table 7.6).  The  stability  of  -2  oxidation  state  decreases  down  the  group. Polonium  hardly  shows  –2  oxidation  state.  Since  electronegativity  of oxygen is very high, it shows only negative oxidation state as –2 except in the case of OF 2  where its oxidation state is + 2. Other elements of the group exhibit + 2, + 4, + 6 oxidation states but + 4 and + 6 are more common. Sulphur, selenium and tellurium usually show + 4 oxidation state in their compounds with oxygen and + 6 with fluorine. The stability of  +  6  oxidation  state  decreases  down  the  group  and  stability  of  +  4 oxidation  state  increases  (inert  pair  effect).  Bonding  in  +4  and  +6 oxidation states is primarily covalent.  Anomalous  behaviour  of  oxygen  The  anomalous  behaviour  of  oxygen,  like  other  members  of   p -block present  in  second  period  is  due  to  its  small  size  and  high electronegativity. One typical example of effects of small size and high electronegativity  is  the  presence  of  strong  hydrogen  bonding  in  H 2 O which is not found in H 2 S.  7.10.7 Physical Properties 7.10.8 Chemical Properties  Elements of Group 16 generally show lower value of first ionisation enthalpy compared to the corresponding periods of group 15. Why? Due to extra stable half-filled  p  orbitals electronic configurations of Group 15 elements, larger amount of energy is required to remove electrons compared to Group 16 elements.

This geometry is also regarded as  see-saw   geometry. All elements except oxygen form dichlorides and dibromides. These dihalides are formed by  sp 3  hybridisation and thus, have tetrahedral structure. The well known monohalides are dimeric in nature. Examples The absence of  d  orbitals in oxygen limits its covalency to four and in  practice,  rarely  exceeds  two.  On  the  other  hand,  in  case  of  other elements of the group, the valence shells can be expanded and covalence exceeds four. (i)   Reactivity  with  hydrogen :  All  the  elements  of  Group  16  form hydrides of the type H 2 E (E = O, S, Se, Te, Po). Some properties of hydrides are given in Table 7.7. Their acidic character increases from H 2 O to H 2 Te. The increase in acidic character can be explained in terms of decrease in bond enthalpy for the dissociation of H–E bond down the group. Owing to the decrease in enthalpy for the dissociation of H–E bond down the group, the thermal stability of hydrides also decreases from H 2 O to H 2 Po. All the hydrides except water possess reducing property and this character increases from H 2 S to H 2 Te.

As already stated, oxygen reacts with most of the elements of the periodic table  to  form  oxides.  In  many  cases  one  element  forms  two  or  more oxides. The oxides vary widely in their nature and properties. Oxides  can  be  simple  (e.g.,  MgO,  Al 2 O 3   )  or  mixed  (Pb 3 O 4 ,  Fe 3 O 4 ). Simple  oxides  can  be  classified  on  the  basis  of  their  acidic,  basic  or amphoteric  character.  An  oxide  that  combines  with  water  to  give  an acid is termed acidic oxide (e.g., SO 2 , Cl 2 O 7 , CO 2 , N 2 O 5  ).

Such oxides are  known  as  neutral  oxides.  Examples  of  neutral  oxides  are  CO,  NO and N 2 O. Ozone is an allotropic form of oxygen .  It is too   reactive to remain for long in the atmosphere at sea level. At a height of about 20 kilometres, it is formed from atmospheric oxygen in the presence of sunlight. This ozone layer protects the earth’s surface from an excessive concentration of ultraviolet (UV) radiations.  Preparation  When a slow dry stream of oxygen is passed through a silent electrical discharge, conversion of oxygen to ozone (10%) occurs. The product is known  as  ozonised  oxygen. 3O 2   →   2O 3    ∆ H V    (298    K)  =  +142  kJ  mol –1  Since the formation of ozone from oxygen is an endothermic process, it is necessary to use a silent electrical discharge in its preparation to prevent its decomposition. If concentrations of ozone greater than 10 per cent are required, a battery of ozonisers can be used, and pure ozone (b.p. 101.1K) can be condensed  in  a  vessel  surrounded  by  liquid  oxygen.  Properties  Pure  ozone  is  a  pale  blue  gas,  dark  blue  liquid  and  violet-black  solid. Ozone has a characteristic smell and in small concentrations it is harmless. However,  if  the  concentration  rises  above  about  100  parts  per  million, breathing becomes uncomfortable resulting in headache and nausea. Ozone is thermodynamically unstable with respect to oxygen since its decomposition into oxygen results in the liberation of heat ( ∆ H is negative) and an increase in entropy ( ∆ S is positive). These two effects reinforce each other, resulting in large negative Gibbs energy change ( ∆ G) for its conversion into oxygen. It is not really surprising, therefore, high concentrations of ozone can be dangerously explosive. Due  to  the  ease  with  which  it  liberates  atoms  of  nascent  oxygen (O 3    →   O 2   +  O),  it  acts  as  a  powerful  oxidising  agent.  For  example,  it oxidises lead sulphide to lead sulphate and iodide ions to iodine. PbS(s)  +  4O 3 (g)   →   PbSO 4 (s)  +  4O 2 (g) 2I – (aq) + H 2 O(l)  +  O 3 (g)  →  2OH – (aq) + I 2 (s) + O 2 (g) When  ozone  reacts  with  an  excess  of  potassium  iodide  solution buffered with a borate buffer (pH 9.2), iodine is liberated which can be titrated against a standard solution of sodium thiosulphate. This is a quantitative method for estimating O 3  gas.  7 . 1 3 7 . 1 3 7 . 1 3 7 . 1 3 7 . 1 3  O z o n e O z o n e O z o n e O z o n e O z o n e  2022-23"

The acid forms two series of salts: normal sulphates (such as sodium sulphate  and  copper  sulphate)  and  acid  sulphates  (e.g.,  sodium hydrogen sulphate).

Many wet  gases  can  be  dried  by  passing  them  through  sulphuric  acid, provided the gases do not react with the acid.

These are collectively known as the  halogens  (Greek  halo  means salt and  genes  means born i.e., salt producers). The halogens are highly reactive non-metallic elements. Like Groups 1  and  2,  the  elements  of  Group  17  show  great  similarity  amongst themselves.  That  much  similarity  is  not  found  in  the  elements  of other groups of the periodic table. Also, there is a regular gradation in their physical and chemical properties. Astatine and tennessine are radioactive elements. Fluorine and chlorine are fairly abundant while bromine and iodine less so. Fluorine is present mainly as insoluble fluorides (fluorspar CaF 2 , cryolite Na 3 AlF 6  and fluoroapatite 3Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 .CaF 2 )   and small quantities are present in soil, river water plants and bones and teeth of  animals.

All these elements have seven electrons in their outermost shell ( ns 2 np 5 ) which is one electron short of the next noble gas. The halogens have the smallest atomic radii in their respective periods due to maximum effective nuclear charge. The atomic radius of fluorine like the other elements of second period is extremely small. Atomic and ionic radii increase from fluorine to iodine due to increasing number of quantum shells. They  have  little  tendency  to  lose  electron.  Thus  they  have  very  high ionisation enthalpy. Due to increase in atomic size, ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group. Halogens  have  maximum  negative  electron  gain  enthalpy  in  the corresponding periods. This is due to the fact that the atoms of these elements have only one electron less than stable noble gas configurations. Electron gain enthalpy of the elements of the group becomes less negative down the group. However, the negative electron gain enthalpy of fluorine is less than that of chlorine. It is due to small size of fluorine atom. As a  result,  there  are  strong  interelectronic  repulsions  in  the  relatively small 2 p  orbitals of fluorine and thus, the incoming electron does not experience much attraction.  7.18.3 Atomic and Ionic Radii 7.18.4 Ionisation Enthalpy 7.18.5 Electron Gain Enthalpy 7.18.2 Electronic Configuration  Property   F   Cl   Br   I   At a  Atomic  number   9   17   35   53   85 Atomic  mass/g  mol –1   19.00   35.45   79.90   126.90   210 Electronic  configuration   [He]2 s 2 2 p 5   [Ne]3 s 2 3 p 5   [Ar]3 d 10 4 s 2 4 p 5   [Kr]4 d 10 5 s 2 5 p 5   [Xe]4 f 14 5 d 10 6 s 2 6 p 5  Covalent  radius/pm   64   99   114   133   – Ionic  radius  X – /pm   133   184   196   220   – Ionisation  enthalpy/kJ  mol –1   1680   1256   1142   1008   – Electron  gain  enthalpy/kJ  mol –1   –333   –349   –325   –296   – Electronegativity b   4   3.2   3.0   2.7   2.2  ∆ Hyd H (X – )/kJ  mol –1   515   381   347   305   –  F 2   Cl 2   Br 2   I 2   –  Melting  point/K   54.4   172.0   265.8   386.6   – Boiling  point/K   84.9   239.0   332.5   458.2   – Density/g  cm –3   1.5  (85) c   1.66  (203) c   3.19(273) c   4.94(293) d   – Distance  X  –  X/pm   143   199   228   266   – Bond  dissociation  enthalpy   158.8   242.6   192.8   151.1   – /(kJ  mol –1 )  E V /V e   2.87   1.36   1.09   0.54   –  Table  7.8:  Atomic  and  Physical  Properties  of  Halogens  a   Radioactive;   b   Pauling  scale;   c   For  the  liquid  at  temperatures  (K)  given  in  the  parentheses;   d   solid;   e   The half-cell  reaction  is  X 2 (g)  +  2e –    →   2X – (aq). 2022-23"

Example  7.15Example  7.15Example  7.15Example  7.15Example  7.15 SolutionSolution SolutionSolutionSolution  Halogens display smooth variations in their physical properties. Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid. Their melting and boiling points steadily increase with atomic number. All halogens are coloured. This is due to absorption of radiations in visible region which results in the excitation of outer electrons to higher energy level. By absorbing different quanta of radiation, they display different colours. For example, F 2 , has yellow, Cl 2  , greenish yellow, Br 2 , red and I 2 , violet colour. Fluorine and chlorine react with water. Bromine and iodine are only sparingly soluble in water but are soluble in various organic  solvents  such  as  chloroform,  carbon  tetrachloride,  carbon disulphide and hydrocarbons to give coloured solutions. One  curious  anomaly  we  notice  from  Table  7.8  is  the  smaller enthalpy  of  dissociation  of  F 2   compared  to  that  of  Cl 2   whereas  X-X bond dissociation enthalpies from chlorine onwards show the expected  trend: Cl – Cl > Br – Br > I – I. A reason for this anomaly is the relatively large electron-electron repulsion among the lone pairs in F 2  molecule where they are much closer to each other than in case of Cl 2 . 2022-23"

                    "content": "Chemistry  The higher oxidation states of chlorine, bromine and iodine are realised mainly when the halogens are in combination with the small and highly electronegative fluorine and oxygen atoms. e.g., in interhalogens, oxides and oxoacids. The oxidation states of +4 and +6 occur in the oxides and oxoacids of chlorine and bromine. The fluorine atom has no  d  orbitals in its valence shell and therefore cannot expand its octet. Being the most electronegative, it exhibits only –1 oxidation state. All  the  halogens  are  highly  reactive.  They  react  with  metals  and non-metals to form halides. The reactivity of the halogens decreases down  the  group. The  ready  acceptance  of  an  electron  is  the  reason  for  the  strong oxidising nature of halogens. F 2  is the strongest oxidising halogen and it oxidises other halide ions in solution or even in the solid phase. In general, a halogen oxidises halide ions of higher atomic number.

Fluorine oxidises water to oxygen whereas chlorine and bromine react with water to form corresponding hydrohalic and  hypohalous  acids.  The  reaction  of  iodine  with  water  is  non- spontaneous. In fact, I –  can be oxidised by oxygen in acidic medium; just the reverse of the reaction observed with fluorine.

For example, ionisation enthalpy,  electronegativity,  and  electrode  potentials  are  all  higher  for fluorine than expected from the trends set by other halogens. Also, ionic and covalent radii, m.p. and b.p., enthalpy of bond dissociation and electron gain enthalpy are quite lower than expected. The anomalous behaviour of fluorine is due to its small size, highest electronegativity, low F-F bond dissociation enthalpy, and non availability of   d  orbitals in valence shell. Most of the reactions of fluorine are exothermic (due to the small and strong bond formed by it with other elements). It forms only one oxoacid  while  other  halogens  form  a  number  of  oxoacids.  Hydrogen fluoride  is  a  liquid  (b.p.  293  K)  due  to  strong  hydrogen  bonding.

Fluorine forms two oxides OF 2  and O 2 F 2 . However, only OF 2  is thermally stable at 298 K. These oxides are  essentially  oxygen  fluorides  because  of  the  higher electronegativity of fluorine than oxygen. Both are strong fluorinating agents. O 2 F 2  oxidises plutonium to PuF 6  and the reaction is used in removing plutonium as PuF 6  from spent nuclear fuel. Chlorine, bromine and iodine form oxides in which the oxidation states of these halogens range from +1 to +7. A combination of kinetic and thermodynamic factors lead to the generally decreasing order of stability of oxides formed by halogens, I > Cl > Br. Higher stability of oxides  of  iodine  is  due  to  greater  polarisability  of  bond  between iodine and oxygen. In the case of chlorine, multiple bond formation between  chlorine  and  oxygen  takes  place  due  to  availability  of  d –orbitals. This leads to increase in stability. Bromine lacks both the characteristics hence stability of oxides of bromine is least. The higher oxides of halogens tend to be more stable than the lower ones. Chlorine oxides, Cl 2 O, ClO 2 , Cl 2 O 6  and Cl 2 O 7  are highly reactive oxidising agents and tend to explode. ClO 2  is used as a bleaching agent for paper pulp and textiles and in water treatment. The  bromine  oxides,  Br 2 O,  BrO 2   ,  BrO 3   are  the  least  stable halogen  oxides  (middle  row  anomally)  and  exist  only  at  low temperatures. They are very powerful oxidising agents. The  iodine  oxides,  I 2 O 4   ,  I 2 O 5 ,  I 2 O 7   are  insoluble  solids  and decompose on heating. I 2 O 5  is a very good oxidising agent and is used in the estimation of carbon monoxide.

The two lone pairs will occupy the equatorial positions to minimise lone pair-lone pair and the bond pair- lone pair repulsions which are greater than the bond pair-bond  pair  repulsions.  In  addition,  the  axial fluorine atoms will be bent towards the equatorial fluorine in order to minimise the lone-pair-lone pair repulsions.

Many of the properties of noble gases  including  their  inactive  nature  are  ascribed  to  their  closed shell structures. Due  to  stable  electronic  configuration  these  gases  exhibit  very  high ionisation enthalpy. However, it decreases down the group with increase in atomic size. Atomic  radii  increase  down  the  group  with  increase  in  atomic number. Since noble gases have stable electronic configurations, they have no tendency to accept the electron and therefore, have large positive values of electron gain enthalpy.  Physical  Properties  All  the  noble  gases  are  monoatomic.  They  are  colourless,  odourless and tasteless. They are sparingly soluble in water. They have very low melting  and  boiling  points  because  the  only  type  of  interatomic interaction in these elements is weak dispersion forces. Helium has the lowest boiling point (4.2 K) of any known substance. It has an unusual property of diffusing through most commonly used laboratory materials such as rubber, glass or plastics.  7.23.2   Electronic Configuration 7.23.3   Ionisation Enthalpy 7.23.4   Atomic Radii 7.23.5   Electron Gain Enthalpy  Chemical  Properties  In general, noble gases are least reactive. Their inertness to chemical reactivity is attributed to the following reasons: (i)   The noble gases except helium (1s 2 ) have completely filled  ns 2 np 6  electronic configuration in their valence shell. (ii)   They  have  high  ionisation  enthalpy  and  more  positive  electron gain enthalpy. The  reactivity  of  noble  gases  has  been  investigated  occasionally, ever  since  their  discovery,  but  all  attempts  to  force  them  to  react  to form the compounds, were unsuccessful for quite a few years. In March 1962, Neil Bartlett, then at the University of British Columbia, observed the reaction of a noble gas. First, he prepared a red compound which is  formulated  as  O 2 + PtF 6 – .  He,  then  realised  that  the  first  ionisation enthalpy of molecular oxygen (1175 kJmol –1 ) was almost identical with that of xenon (1170 kJ mol –1 ). He made efforts to prepare same type of compound with Xe and was successful in preparing another red colour compound Xe + PtF 6 –  by mixing PtF 6  and xenon. After this discovery, a number of xenon compounds mainly with most electronegative elements like fluorine and oxygen, have been synthesised. The compounds of krypton are fewer. Only the difluoride (KrF 2 ) has been  studied  in  detail.  Compounds  of  radon  have  not  been  isolated  Noble gases have very low boiling points. Why? Noble gases being monoatomic have no interatomic forces except weak dispersion  forces  and  therefore,  they  are  liquefied  at  very  low temperatures. Hence, they have low boiling points.

                    "content": "Chemistry  SummarySummary SummarySummarySummary  Groups 13 to 18 of the periodic table consist of   p -block elements  with their valence shell  electronic  configuration   ns 2 np 1–6 .  Groups  13  and  14  were  dealt  with  in  Class XI.  In  this  Unit    remaining  groups  of  the   p -block  have  been  discussed.  Group  15   consists  of  five  elements  namely,  N,  P,  As,  Sb  and  Bi  which  have general  electronic  configuration   ns 2 np 3 .  Nitrogen  differs  from  other  elements  of  this group  due  to  small  size,    formation  of   p πππππ – p πππππ   multiple  bonds   with  itself  and  with highly electronegative atom like O or C and  non-availability of  d  orbitals  to expand its valence shell. Elements of group 15 show gradation in properties. They react with oxygen,  hydrogen  and  halogens.  They  exhibit  two  important  oxidation  states,  +  3 and  +  5  but  +3  oxidation  is  favoured  by  heavier  elements  due  to  ‘inert  pair  effect’. Dinitrogen can be prepared in laboratory as well as on industrial scale. It forms oxides  in  various  oxidation  states  as  N 2 O,  NO,  N 2 O 3 ,  NO 2 ,  N 2 O 4   and  N 2 O 5 .  These oxides  have   resonating  structures   and  have  multiple  bonds.  Ammonia  can  be prepared  on  large  scale  by   Haber’s  process .  HNO 3   is  an  important  industrial chemical.  It  is  a  strong  monobasic  acid  and  is  a  powerful  oxidising  agent.  Metals and  non-metals  react  with  HNO 3   under  different  conditions  to  give  NO  or  NO 2 . Phosphorus exists as P 4  in elemental form. It exists in several  allotropic forms . It forms hydride, PH 3  which is a highly poisonous gas. It forms two types of halides as PX 3  and PX 5 . PCl 3  is prepared by the reaction of white phosphorus with dry chlorine while PCl 5  is prepared by the reaction of phosphorus with SO 2 Cl 2 . Phosphorus forms a  number  of  oxoacids.  Depending  upon  the  number  of  P–OH  groups,  their  basicity varies.  The  oxoacids  which  have  P–H  bonds  are  good    reducing  agents.  The Group 16  elements have general electronic configuration  ns 2 np 4 . They show maximum  oxidation  state,  +6.  Gradation  in  physical  and  chemical  properties  is observed  in  the  group  16  elements.  In  laboratory,  dioxygen  is  prepared  by  heating KClO 3  in presence of MnO 2 . It forms a number of oxides with metals. Allotropic form of oxygen is O 3  which is a highly oxidising agent. Sulphur forms a number of allotropes. Of these,  α – and  β – forms of sulphur are the most important. Sulphur combines with oxygen  to  give  oxides  such  as  SO 2   and  SO 3 .  SO 2   is  prepared  by  the  direct  union  of sulphur  with  oxygen.  SO 2   is  used  in  the  manufacture  of  H 2 SO 4 .  Sulphur  forms  a number  of  oxoacids.  Amongst  them,  the  most  important  is  H 2 SO 4 .  It  is  prepared  by  contact process . It is a dehydrating and oxidising agent. It is used in the manufacture of  several  compounds.  Group 17  of the periodic table consists of the following elements F, Cl, Br, I and At.These  elements  are  extremely  reactive  and  as  such  they  are  found  in  the combined state only. The common oxidation state of these elements is –1. However, highest  oxidation  state  can  be  +7.  They  show  regular  gradation  in  physical  and chemical  properties.  They  form  oxides,  hydrogen  halides,  interhalogen  compounds and oxoacids. Chlorine is conveniently obtained by the reaction of HCl with KMnO 4 . HCl  is  prepared  by  heating  NaCl  with  concentrated  H 2 SO 4 .  Halogens  combine  with one  another  to  form   interhalogen  compounds   of  the  type  XX 1 n   (n  =  1,  3,  5,  7) where  X 1   is  lighter  than  X.  A  number  of  oxoacids  of  halogens  are  known.  In  the structures  of  these  oxoacids,  halogen  is  the  central  atom  which  is  bonded  in  each case with one OH bond as X–OH. In some cases X = 0 bonds are also found.  Group 18  of the periodic table consists of  noble gases . They have  ns 2   np 6  valence shell  electronic  configuration  except  He  which  has  1 s 2 .  All  the  gases  except  Rn occur  in  atmosphere.  Rn  is  obtained  as  the  decay  product  of   226 Ra. Due  to  complete  octet  of  outermost  shell,  they  have  less  tendency  to  form compounds.  The  best  characterised  compounds  are  those  of  xenon  with  fluorine and oxygen only under certain conditions. These gases have several uses. Argon is used to provide inert atmosphere, helium is used in filling balloons for meteorological observations,  neon  is  used  in  discharge  tubes  and  fluorescent  bulbs. 2022-23"

Answers  to  Some  Intext  Questions 7.1   Higher the positive oxidation state of central atom, more will be its polarising power  which,  in  turn,  increases  the  covalent  character  of  bond  formed between  the  central  atom  and  the  other  atom.  7.2   Because  BiH 3   is  the  least  stable  among  the  hydrides  of  Group  15.  7.3   Because  of  strong  p π –p π   overlap  resulting  into  the  triple  bond,  N ≡ N.  7.6   From  the  structure  of  N 2 O 5   it  is  evident  that  covalence  of  nitrogen  is  four.  7.7 (a)   Both  are  sp 3   hybridised.  In  PH 4 +   all  the  four  orbitals  are  bonded  whereas in  PH 3   there  is  a  lone  pair  of  electrons  on  P,  which  is  responsible  for  lone pair-bond  pair  repulsion  in   PH 3   reducing  the  bond  angle  to  less  than 109°  28 ′ .  7.10   PCl 5   +  H 2 O   →   POCl 3   +  2HCl  7.11   Three  P–OH  groups  are  present  in  the  molecule  of  H 3 PO 4 .  Therefore,  its basicity  is  three.  7.15   Because  of  small  size  and  high  electronegativity  of  oxygen,  molecules  of water  are  highly  associated  through  hydrogen  bonding  resulting  in  its  liquid  state.  7.21   Both the S–O bonds are covalent and have equal strength due to resonating structures.  7.25   H 2 SO 4   is  a  very  strong  acid  in  water  largely  because  of  its  first  ionisation to  H 3 O +   and  HSO 4 – .  The  ionisation  of  HSO 4   –    to  H 3 O +   and  SO 4 2–   is  very  very small.  That  is  why  K a 2   <<  K a 1 .  7.31   In  general,  interhalogen  compounds  are  more  reactive  than  halogens    due to  weaker  X–X 1   bonding  than  X–X  bond.  Thus,  ICl  is  more  reactive  than  I 2 .  7.34   Radon  is  radioactive  with  very  short  half-life  which  makes  the  study  of chemistry  of  radon  difficult. 2022-23"

For example, Monohalocompounds  may  further  be  classified  according  to  the hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the halogen is bonded, as discussed below. This class includes  (a) Alkyl halides or haloalkanes (R—X)  In alkyl halides, the halogen atom is bonded to an alkyl group (R). They  form  a  homologous  series  represented  by  C n H 2n+1 X.  They  are further classified as primary, secondary or tertiary according to the nature of carbon to which halogen is attached. If halogen is attached to a primary carbon atom in an alkyl halide, the alkyl halide is called primary alkyl halide or 1° alkyl halide. Similarly, if halogen is attached to  secondary  or  tertiary  carbon  atom,  the  alkyl  halide  is  called secondary alkyl halide (2°) and tertiary (3°) alkyl halide, respectively.  (b)   Allylic halides  These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to an  sp 3 -hybridised carbon atom adjacent to carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)  i.e.  to an allylic carbon.

The common names of alkyl halides are derived by naming the alkyl group followed by the name of halide. In the IUPAC system of nomenclature, alkyl halides are named as halosubstituted hydrocarbons. For mono halogen substituted derivatives of benzene, common and IUPAC names are the same.

The above methods are not applicable for the preparation of aryl halides because the carbon-oxygen bond in phenols has a partial double bond  character  and  is  difficult  to  break  being  stronger  than  a  single bond.  (I)   From  alkanes  by  free  radical  halogenation  Free radical chlorination or bromination of alkanes gives a complex mixture of isomeric mono- and polyhaloalkanes, which is difficult to The hydroxyl group of an alcohol is replaced by halogen on reaction with concentrated  halogen  acids,  phosphorus  halides  or  thionyl  chloride. Thionyl chloride is preferred because in this reaction alkyl halide is formed along with gases SO 2  and HCl. The two gaseous products are escapable, hence, the reaction gives pure alkyl halides. The reactions of primary and secondary alcohols with HCl require the presence of a catalyst, ZnCl 2 . With tertiary alcohols, the reaction is conducted by simply shaking the alcohol  with  concentrated  HCl  at  room  temperature.  Constant  boiling with  HBr  (48%)  is  used  for  preparing  alkyl  bromide.  Good  yields  of R—I  may  be  obtained  by  heating  alcohols  with  sodium  or  potassium iodide in 95% orthophosphoric acid. The order of reactivity of alcohols with a given haloacid is 3°>2°>1°. Phosphorus tribromide and triiodide are usually generated  in situ  (produced in the reaction mixture) by the reaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine respectively.  6.4.1  From  Alcohols  6 . 46 . 4  6 . 4 6 . 4 6 . 4  Methods  ofMethods  ofMethods  ofMethods  ofMethods  of PreparationPreparation PreparationPreparationPreparation of  Haloalkanesof  Haloalkanesof  Haloalkanesof  Haloalkanesof  Haloalkanes "

Due to greater polarity as well as higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the intermolecular  forces  of  attraction  (dipole-dipole  and  van  der  Waals) are stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points of chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those of the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass. The attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and have more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different halides  is  depicted  in  Fig.  6.1.  For  the  same  alkyl  group,  the  boiling points of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI> RBr> RCl> RF. This is  because  with  the  increase  in  size  and  mass  of  halogen  atom,  the magnitude of van der Waal forces increases. The boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase in branching. For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane has the lowest boiling point among the three isomers. Boiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same. However, the  para- isomers are high melting as compared to their  ortho-  and  meta- isomers.

In order to dissolve haloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between the haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.

As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes in water is low.

Similarly nitrite ion also represents an ambident nucleophile with two different points of linkage [ – O—   N i i =O]. The linkage through oxygen results in alkyl nitrites while through nitrogen atom, it leads to nitroalkanes.  Mechanism:  This reaction has been found to proceed by two different mechanims which are described below:  (a) Substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (S N 2)  The reaction between CH 3 Cl and hydroxide ion to yield methanol and chloride ion follows a second order kinetics, i.e., the rate depends upon the concentration of both the reactants.  Haloalkanes react with KCN to form alkyl cyanides as main product while AgCN forms isocyanides as the chief product. Explain. KCN  is  predominantly  ionic  and  provides  cyanide  ions  in  solution. Although both carbon and nitrogen atoms are in a position to donate electron pairs, the attack takes place mainly through carbon atom and not through nitrogen atom since C—C bond is more stable than C—N bond. However, AgCN is mainly covalent in nature and nitrogen is free to donate electron pair forming isocyanide as the main product.

It   depicts a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S N 2) reaction; the  incoming  nucleophile  interacts  with  alkyl  halide  causing  the carbon-halide  bond  to  break  and  a  new  bond  is  formed  between carbon and attacking nucleophile.

As the reaction progresses and  the  bond  between  the  incoming  nucleophile  and  the  carbon atom  starts  forming,  the  bond  between  carbon  atom  and  leaving group weakens. As this happens, the three carbon-hydrogen bonds of the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In transition state all the three C-H bonds are in the same plane and the attacking  and  leaving  nucleophiles  are  partially  attached  to  the carbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon, C-H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking nucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon. As a result configuration is inverted,   the configuration (See box) of carbon  atom  under  attack  inverts  in  much  the  same  way  as  an umbrella  is  turned  inside  out  when  caught  in  a  strong  wind.  This process  is  called  as   inversion  of  configuration .  In  the  transition state,  the  carbon  atom  is  simultaneously  bonded  to  incoming nucleophile  and  the  outgoing  leaving  group.  Such  structures  are unstable and cannot be isolated. Thus, in the transition state, carbon is simultaneously bonded to five atoms.  Hughes  worked  under Ingold  and  earned  a D.Sc.  degree  from  the University of London.  Since this reaction requires the approach of the nucleophile to the carbon bearing the leaving group, the presence of bulky substituents on or near the carbon atom have a dramatic inhibiting effect. Of the simple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in S N 2 reactions because there are only three small hydrogen atoms.

It involves the C–Br bond breaking for which the energy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since the rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the concentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater the stability of carbocation, greater will be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster will be the rate of reaction. In case of alkyl halides, 3 0  alkyl halides undergo S N 1 reaction very fast because of the high stability of 3 0  carbocations. We  can sum up the order of reactivity of alkyl halides towards S N 1 and S N 2 reactions as follows: For the same reasons, allylic and benzylic halides show high reactivity towards the S N 1 reaction.

(i)   Optical  activity :  Plane  of  plane  polarised  light  produced  by passing ordinary light through Nicol prism is rotated when it is passed through the solutions of  certain compounds. Such compounds are called  optically active  compounds. The angle by which the plane polarised light is rotated is measured by an instrument called polarimeter. If the compound rotates the plane of plane polarised light to the right, i.e., clockwise direction, it is called  dextrorotatory  (Greek for right rotating) or the  d -form and is indicated by placing a positive (+) sign before the degree of  rotation.  If  the  light  is  rotated  towards  left  (anticlockwise direction),  the  compound  is  said  to  be  laevo-rotatory  or  the  l -form  and  a  negative  (–)  sign  is  placed  before  the  degree  of rotation.  Such  (+)  and  (–)  isomers  of  a  compound  are  called  optical  isomers   and  the  phenomenon  is  termed  as   optical isomerism . (ii)   Molecular  asymmetry,  chirality  and  enantiomers :  The observation  of  Louis  Pasteur  (1848)  that  crystals  of  certain compounds  exist  in  the  form  of  mirror  images  laid  the foundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that aqueous  solutions  of  both  types  of  crystals  showed  optical rotation, equal in magnitude (for solution of equal concentration) but  opposite  in  direction.  He  believed  that  this  difference  in optical  activity  was  associated  with  the  three  dimensional arrangements  of  atoms  in  the  molecules  ( configurations )  of (i)   CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 Br < (CH 3 ) 2 CHCH 2 Br < CH 3 CH 2 CH(Br)CH 3  < (CH 3 ) 3 CBr  (S N 1) CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 Br > (CH 3 ) 2 CHCH 2 Br > CH 3 CH 2 CH(Br)CH 3   > (CH 3 ) 3 CBr (S N 2) Of the two primary bromides, the carbocation intermediate derived from (CH 3 ) 2 CHCH 2 Br is more stable than derived from CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 Br because of greater electron donating inductive effect of (CH 3 ) 2 CH- group. Therefore, (CH 3 ) 2 CHCH 2 Br is more reactive than CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 Br in S N 1 reactions. CH 3 CH 2 CH(Br)CH 3   is  a  secondary  bromide  and  (CH 3 ) 3 CBr    is  a  tertiary bromide. Hence the above order is followed in S N 1. The reactivity in S N 2 reactions  follows  the  reverse  order  as  the  steric  hinderance  around  the electrophilic carbon increases in that order. (ii)   C 6 H 5 C(CH 3 )(C 6 H 5 )Br > C 6 H 5 CH(C 6 H 5 )Br >  C 6 H 5 CH(CH 3 )Br > C 6 H 5 CH 2 Br (S N 1) C 6 H 5 C(CH 3 )(C 6 H 5 )Br < C 6 H 5 CH(C 6 H 5 )Br <  C 6 H 5 CH(CH 3 )Br < C 6 H 5 CH 2 Br (S N 2) Of  the  two  secondary  bromides,  the  carbocation  intermediate  obtained from C 6 H 5 CH(C 6 H 5 )Br is more stable than obtained from C 6 H 5 CH(CH 3 )Br because it is stabilised by two phenyl groups due to resonance. Therefore, the  former  bromide  is  more  reactive  than  the  latter  in  S N 1  reactions.  A phenyl group is bulkier than a methyl group. Therefore, C 6 H 5 CH(C 6 H 5 )Br is less reactive than C 6 H 5 CH(CH 3 )Br in S N 2 reactions.

Le  Bel   in  the  same  year  (1874),  independently argued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies) around a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents attached to that carbon are different, the mirror image of the molecule  is  not  superimposed  (overlapped)  on  the  molecule; such a carbon is called  asymmetric carbon  or  stereocentre . The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to as asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along with non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for the optical activity in such organic compounds. The symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day objects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to their  mirror  images  and  can  be  superimposed. However, many objects are non superimposable on their mirror images. For example, your left and right hand look similar but if you put your left hand on your right hand by moving them in the same plane, they do not coincide. The objects which are non- superimposable on their mirror image (like a pair of hands) are said to be  chiral  and this property is known as  chirality . Chiral molecules are optically active, while the objects, which are, superimposable on their mirror images are called  achiral.  These molecules are optically inactive. The above test of molecular chirality can be applied  to  organic  molecules  by  constructing models and its mirror images or by drawing three dimensional  structures  and  attempting  to superimpose them in our minds. There are other aids, however, that can assist us in recognising chiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of As you can see very clearly, propan-2-ol (A) does not contain an asymmetric carbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not different. We rotate the mirror image (B) of the molecule by 180° (structure C) and try to overlap the structure (C) with the structure (A), these structures completely overlap. Thus propan-2-ol is an  achiral  molecule.  Jacobus  Hendricus Van’t  Hoff  (1852-1911) received  the  first  Nobel Prize  in  Chemistry  in 1901  for  his  work  on solutions.

Enantiomers possess identical physical properties namely, melting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ with respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the enantiomer  is   dextro rotatory,   the  other  will  be   laevo  rotatory . A mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions will have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer will be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such a  mixture  is  known  as   racemic  mixture   or   racemic modification . A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing  dl  or ( ± ) before the name, for example ( ± ) butan-2-ol. The process of conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as  racemisation.

In general, if during a reaction, no bond to the stereocentre is broken, the  product  will  have  the  same  general  configuration  of  groups around the stereocentre as that of reactant. Such a reaction is said to  proceed  with  retention  of  the  configuration.  Consider  as  an example, the reaction that takes place when (–)-2-methylbutan-1-ol is heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid.  SolutionSolution SolutionSolutionSolution  It is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in the reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation has  changed  in  the  product.  This  is  so  because  two  different compounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have different optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory (plus sign of optical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory (negative sign of optical rotation). (iv)   Inversion,  retention  and  racemisation:   There  are  three  outcomes for a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly linked  to  an  asymmetric  carbon  atom  is  broken.  Consider  the replacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction; If (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention of configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A. If (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion of configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B. "

Now  let  us  have  a  fresh  look  at  S N 1  and  S N 2  mechanisms  by taking  examples  of  optically  active  alkyl  halides.  In case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a result of S N 2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared to the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the side  opposite  to  the  one  where  the  halogen  atom  is  present.  When (–)-2-bromooctane  is  allowed  to  react  with  sodium  hydroxide, (+)-octan-2-ol  is  formed  with  the  –OH  group  occupying  the  position opposite to what bromide had occupied. Thus, S N 2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by inversion of configuration. In  case  of  optically  active  alkyl  halides,  S N 1  reactions  are accompanied  by  racemisation.  Can  you  think  of  the  reason  why  it happens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being  sp 2  hybridised  is  planar  (achiral).  The  attack  of  the  nucleophile  may  be accomplished from either side  of the plane of   carbocation resulting in a  mixture  of  products,  one  having  the  same  configuration  (the  –OH attaching  on  the  same  position  as  halide  ion)  and  the  other  having opposite configuration (the –OH attaching on the side opposite to halide ion).  This  may  be  illustrated  by  hydrolysis  of  optically  active 2-bromobutane, which results in the formation of ( ± )-butan-2-ol.  2. Elimination  reactions  When a haloalkane with  b -hydrogen atom is heated with alcoholic solution  of  potassium  hydroxide,  there  is  elimination  of  hydrogen atom from  b -carbon and a halogen atom from the  a -carbon atom.  Location of  aa aaa  and  bbbbb  carbon in a molecule  Carbon  on  which halogen  atom  is directly  attached  is called  a -carbon and the  carbon  atom adjacent  to  this carbon  is  called  b -carbon.

If there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to the availability of more than one  b -hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene is  formed  as  the  major  product.  These  form  part  of  a  pattern  first observed by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev (also pronounced as Saytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as “ in  dehydrohalogenation  reactions,  the  preferred  product  is  that alkene  which  has  the  greater  number  of  alkyl  groups  attached  to  the doubly  bonded  carbon  atoms .”  Thus,  2-bromopentane  gives pent-2-ene as the major product.  3. Reaction  with  metals  Most  organic  chlorides,  bromides  and  iodides  react  with  certain metals  to  give  compounds  containing  carbon-metal  bonds.  Such compounds  are  known  as   organo-metallic  compounds .  An important class of organo-metallic compounds discovered by Victor Grignard  in  1900  is  alkyl  magnesium  halide,  RMgX,  referred  as  Grignard Reagents . These reagents are obtained by the reaction of haloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether.  A  chemical  reaction  is  the  result  of  competition;  it  is  a  race  that  is  won  by  the  fastest runner.  A  collection  of  molecules  tend  to  do,  by  and  large,  what  is  easiest  for  them.  An alkyl  halide  with   b -hydrogen  atoms  when  reacted  with  a  base  or  a  nucleophile  has  two competing  routes:  substitution  (S N 1  and  S N 2)  and  elimination.  Which  route  will  be  taken up  depends  upon  the  nature  of  alkyl  halide,  strength  and  size  of  base/nucleophile  and reaction  conditions.  Thus,  a  bulkier  nucleophile  will  prefer  to  act  as  a  base  and  abstracts a  proton  rather  than  approach  a  tetravalent  carbon  atom  (steric  reasons)  and   vice  versa . Similarly,  a  primary  alkyl  halide  will  prefer  a  S N 2  reaction,  a  secondary  halide-  S N 2  or elimination  depending  upon  the  strength  of  base/nucleophile  and  a  tertiary  halide-  S N 1  or elimination  depending  upon  the  stability  of  carbocation  or  the  more  substituted  alkene.

When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was not  to  the  mathematical  province  of  physical  chemistry  but  to  organic chemistry.  While  attempting  to  find  an  efficient  catalyst  for  the  process of methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this purpose  and  wondered  whether  the  Mg/ether  combination  might  be successful.  Grignard  reagents  were  first  reported  in  1900  and  Grignard used this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained a professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded the  Nobel  prize  for  Chemistry  which  he  shared  with  Paul  Sabatier  who had  made  advances  in  nickel  catalysed  hydrogenation.   In the Grignard reagent, the carbon-magnesium bond is covalent but highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive magnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic. Grignard  reagents  are  highly  reactive  and  react  with  any  source  of proton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are sufficiently acidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons. It is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard reagent.  That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether.  On the other hand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting halides to hydrocarbons.  Wurtz  reaction  Alkyl  halides  react  with  sodium  in  dry  ether  to  give    hydrocarbons containing double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide. This reaction is known as Wurtz reaction.  1. Nucleophilic  substitution  Aryl  halides  are  extremely  less  reactive  towards  nucleophilic substitution reactions due to the following reasons: (i)   Resonance effect :  In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen atom  are  in  conjugation  with   p -electrons  of  the  ring  and  the following resonating structures are possible. C—Cl  bond  acquires  a  partial  double  bond  character  due  to resonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult than haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction.  6.7.2   Reactions of Haloarenes "

The  sp 2  hybridised carbon with a greater  s -character is more electronegative  and  can  hold  the  electron  pair  of  C—X  bond more  tightly  than   sp 3 -hybridised  carbon  in  haloalkane  with less   s -chararcter.  Thus,  C—Cl  bond  length  in  haloalkane  is 177pm  while  in  haloarene  is  169  pm.  Since  it  is  difficult  to break a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes are  less  reactive  than  haloalkanes  towards  nucleophilic substitution reaction. (iii)   Instability of phenyl cation:  In case of haloarenes, the phenyl cation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised by resonance and therefore, S N 1 mechanism is ruled out. (iv)   Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron rich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes.

Why? Chlorine  withdraws  electrons  through  inductive  effect  and  releases electrons  through  resonance.  Through  inductive  effect,  chlorine destabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic substitution. Through  resonance,  halogen  tends  to  stabilise  the  carbocation  and the  effect  is  more  pronounced  at   ortho -  and   para -  positions.  The inductive  effect  is  stronger  than  resonance  and  causes  net  electron withdrawal  and  thus  causes  net  deactivation.  The  resonance  effect tends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at  ortho - and  para - positions and hence makes the deactivation less for  ortho - and  para - attack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect and orientation is controlled by resonance effect.

                    "content": "Haloalkanes  and  Haloarenes  Carbon compounds containing more than one halogen atom are usually referred to as polyhalogen compounds. Many of these compounds are useful in industry and agriculture. Some polyhalogen compounds are described in this section. Dichloromethane  is  widely  used  as  a  solvent  as  a  paint  remover,  as  a propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene chloride  harms  the  human  central  nervous  system.  Exposure  to  lower levels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing and  vision.  Higher  levels  of  methylene  chloride  in  air  cause  dizziness, nausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct skin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild redness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea. Chemically,  chloroform  is  employed  as  a  solvent  for  fats,  alkaloids, iodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in the  production  of  the  freon  refrigerant  R-22.  It  was  once  used  as  a general  anaesthetic  in  surgery  but  has  been  replaced  by  less  toxic, safer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as an  anaesthetic,  inhaling  chloroform  vapours  depresses  the  central nervous system. Breathing about 900 parts of chloroform per million parts of air (900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage to the liver (where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the kidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in chloroform.  Chloroform  is  slowly  oxidised  by  air  in  the  presence  of light to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene.  It  is  therefore  stored  in  closed  dark  coloured  bottles completely filled so that air is kept out. It was used earlier as an antiseptic but the antiseptic properties are due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due to its objectionable smell, it has been replaced by other formulations containing iodine. It  is  produced  in  large  quantities  for  use  in  the  manufacture  of refrigerants  and  propellants  for  aerosol  cans.  It  is  also  used  as feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and general solvent use. Until the mid 1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry, as a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire extinguisher.  There  is  some  evidence  that  exposure  to  carbon tetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects are dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause permanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead rapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to CCl 4  can make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate the eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air, it rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer.

The chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively known as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non-toxic, non- corrosive  and  easily  liquefiable  gases.  Freon  12  (CCl 2 F 2 )  is  one  of  the most  common  freons  in  industrial  use.  It  is  manufactured  from tetrachloromethane  by   Swarts  reaction.   These  are  usually  produced for aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By 1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds annually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes its  way  into  the  atmosphere  where  it  diffuses  unchanged  into  the stratosphere.  In  stratosphere,  freon  is  able  to  initiate  radical  chain reactions that can upset the natural ozone balance. DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared in  1873,  but  it  was  not  until  1939  that  Paul  Muller  of  Geigy Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased enormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because of its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice that carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT began to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed resistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity towards  fish.  The  chemical  stability  of  DDT  and  its  fat  solubility compounded  the  problem.  DDT  is  not  metabolised  very  rapidly  by animals;  instead,  it  is  deposited  and  stored  in  the  fatty  tissues.  If ingestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal over time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973, although it is still in use in some other parts of the world.  6.8.5  Freons 6.8.6   p,p’ -Dichlo- rodiphenyl- trichloro- ethane(DDT)  SummarySummary SummarySummarySummary  Alkyl/  Aryl  halides   may  be  classified  as  mono,  di,  or  polyhalogen  (tri-,  tetra-,  etc.) compounds  depending  on  whether  they  contain  one,  two  or  more  halogen  atoms  in their  structures.

Alcohols   and   phenols   are  formed when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and aromatic respectively, is replaced by –OH group. These classes of compounds find wide applications in industry as  well  as  in  day-to-day  life.  For  instance,  have  you ever  noticed  that  ordinary  spirit  used  for  polishing wooden  furniture  is  chiefly  a  compound  containing  hydroxyl group, ethanol. The sugar we eat, the cotton used for fabrics, the paper we use for writing, are all made up of compounds containing –OH groups. Just think of life without paper; no note-books, books, news- papers, currency notes, cheques, certificates, etc. The magazines  carrying  beautiful  photographs  and interesting  stories  would  disappear  from  our  life.  It would have been really a different world. An  alcohol  contains  one  or  more  hydroxyl  (OH) group(s)  directly  attached  to  carbon  atom(s),  of  an aliphatic system (CH 3 OH) while a phenol contains –OH group(s)  directly  attached  to  carbon  atom(s)  of  an aromatic system (C 6 H 5 OH). The  substitution  of  a  hydrogen  atom  in  a hydrocarbon  by  an  alkoxy  or  aryloxy  group (R–O/Ar–O) yields another class of compounds known as ‘ethers’, for example, CH 3 OCH 3  (dimethyl ether).

This is due to (i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation of  unshared  electron  pair  of  oxygen  with  the  aromatic  ring (Section 7.4.4) and (ii)  sp 2  hybridised state of carbon to which oxygen is attached. In ethers, the four electron pairs, i.e.,   the two bond pairs and two lone  pairs  of  electrons  on  oxygen  are  arranged  approximately  in  a tetrahedral arrangement. The bond  angle is slightly greater than the tetrahedral  angle  due  to  the  repulsive  interaction  between  the  two bulky (–R) groups. The C–O bond length (141 pm) is almost the same as in alcohols.  7.4.1   Preparation of Alcohols  Alcohols are prepared by the following methods:  1.

This reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e., stronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note that an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide ion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium ethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide). Alcohols  act  as  Bronsted  bases  as  well.  It  is  due  to  the presence  of  unshared  electron  pairs  on  oxygen,  which  makes them proton acceptors.  (iii)   Acidity  of  phenols:   The  reactions  of  phenol  with  metals  (e.g., sodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic nature.  The  hydroxyl  group,  in  phenol  is  directly  attached  to the   sp 2   hybridised  carbon  of  benzene  ring  which  acts  as  an electron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution in  phenol  molecule,  as  depicted  in  its  resonance  structures, causes  the  oxygen  of  –OH  group  to  be  positive. The  reaction  of  phenol  with  aqueous  sodium  hydroxide indicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water.

Esterification  Alcohols and phenols react with carboxylic acids, acid chlorides and acid anhydrides to form esters. In substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing groups  such  as  nitro  group,  enhances  the  acidic  strength  of phenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is present  at   ortho   and   para   positions.  It  is  due  to  the  effective delocalisation  of  negative  charge  in  phenoxide  ion  when substituent  is  at  ortho  or  para  position.  On  the  other  hand, electron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do not favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease in acid strength.

                    "content": "Chemistry  Methanol  and  ethanol  are  among  the  two  commercially  important alcohols.  1.   Methanol  Methanol, CH 3 OH, also known as ‘wood spirit’, was produced by destructive  distillation  of  wood.  Today,  most  of  the  methanol  is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide at high pressure  and  temperature  and  in  the  presence  of  ZnO  –  Cr 2 O 3  catalyst. Methanol is a colourless liquid and boils at 337 K.  It is highly poisonous in nature.  Ingestion of even small quantities of methanol can cause blindness and large quantities causes even death. Methanol is  used  as  a  solvent  in  paints,  varnishes  and  chiefly  for  making formaldehyde.  2.   Ethanol  Ethanol, C 2 H 5 OH, is obtained commercially by fermentation, the oldest method is from sugars.  The sugar in molasses, sugarcane or fruits such as grapes is converted to glucose and fructose, (both of which have the formula C 6 H 12 O 6 ), in the presence of an enzyme, invertase.  Glucose  and  fructose  undergo  fermentation  in  the presence of another enzyme, zymase, which is found in yeast. In wine making, grapes are the source of sugars and yeast. As grapes ripen, the quantity of sugar increases and yeast grows on the outer skin. When grapes are crushed, sugar and the enzyme come in contact  and  fermentation  starts.  Fermentation  takes  place  in anaerobic conditions i.e. in absence of air. Carbon dioxide is released during fermentation. The action of zymase is inhibited once the percentage of alcohol formed exceeds 14 percent. If air gets into fermentation mixture, the oxygen of air oxidises ethanol to ethanoic acid which in turn destroys the taste of alcoholic drinks. Ethanol is a colourless liquid with boiling point 351 K. It is used as a solvent in paint industry and in the preparation of a number of carbon compounds. The commercial alcohol is made unfit for drinking by mixing in it some copper sulphate (to give it a colour) and pyridine (a foul smelling liquid). It is known as   denaturation  of alcohol. Nowadays, large quantities of ethanol are obtained by hydration of ethene (Section 7.4).  7 . 57 . 5  7 . 57 . 5 7 . 5  SomeSomeSomeSomeSome CommerciallyCommerciallyCommerciallyCommerciallyCommercially ImportantImportant ImportantImportantImportant AlcoholsAlcohols AlcoholsAlcoholsAlcohols  Ingestion of ethanol acts on the central nervous system. In moderate amounts, it affects judgment and lowers inhibitions. Higher concentrations cause nausea and loss of consciousness. Even at higher concentrations, it interferes with spontaneous respiration and can be fatal. "

The formation of  the reaction product, alkene or ether depends  on  the  reaction  conditions.  For  example,  ethanol  is dehydrated to ethene in the presence of sulphuric acid at 443 K. At 413 K, ethoxyethane is the main product. The formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction (S N 2) involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as indicated below:  7 . 67 . 6  7 . 67 . 6 7 . 6  EthersEthers EthersEthersEthers  7.6.1   Preparation of Ethers  Acidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated with substitution reaction to give an ether. The  method  is  suitable  for  the  preparation  of  ethers  having primary alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered and the temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the formation of alkene. The reaction follows S N 1 pathway when the alcohol is secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes. However, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give corresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over substitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed. Can you explain why is bimolecular dehydration not appropriate for the preparation of ethyl methyl ether?  2.   Williamson synthesis  It  is  an  important  laboratory  method  for  the  preparation  of symmetrical and unsymmetrical ethers.  In this method, an alkyl halide is allowed to react with sodium alkoxide.  R – X +   NaR –O ’   R–O–R   +   Na X ’ +– Ethers containing  substituted alkyl groups (secondary or tertiary) may also be prepared by this method. The reaction involves S N 2 attack of an alkoxide ion on primary alkyl halide.  Diethyl ether has been used widely as an inhalation anaesthetic. But due to its slow effect and an unpleasant recovery period, it has been replaced, as an anaesthetic, by other compounds. Alexander William Williamson (1824–1904) was born in London of Scottish parents. In 1849, he became Professor of Chemistry at University College, London. "

In case of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides, elimination competes over substitution. If a tertiary alkyl halide is used, an alkene is the only reaction product and no ether is formed. For example, the reaction of CH 3 ONa with (CH 3 ) 3 C–Br gives exclusively 2-methylpropene. It is because alkoxides are not only nucleophiles but strong bases as well. They react with alkyl halides leading to elimination reactions.  The following is not an appropriate reaction for the preparation of t-butyl ethyl ether.

Both  ethoxyethane  and  butan-1-ol  are miscible to almost the same extent i.e., 7.5 and 9 g per 100 mL water, respectively  while  pentane  is  essentially  immiscible  with  water.  Can you  explain  this  observation  ?  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  just  like alcohols,  oxygen  of  ether  can  also  form  hydrogen  bonds  with  water molecule as shown:  1.   Cleavage of C–O bond in ethers  Ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of C-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess of hydrogen halides.  The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl halide molecules. Alkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the more stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl halide. Ethers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same manner. The  order  of  reactivity  of  hydrogen  halides  is  as  follows: HI > HBr > HCl. The cleavage of ethers takes place with concentrated HI or HBr at high temperature.  7.6.2   Physical Properties 7.6.3   Chemical Reactions "

Alcohols  are  higher  boiling  than  other  classes  of  compounds,  namely hydrocarbons,  ethers  and  haloalkanes  of  comparable  molecular  masses.    The ability  of  alcohols,  phenols  and  ethers  to  form  intermolecular  hydrogen  bonding with  water  makes  them  soluble  in  it. Alcohols  and  phenols  are  acidic  in  nature.   Electron  withdrawing  groups   in phenol  increase  its  acidic  strength  and   electron  releasing  groups   decrease  it. Alcohols  undergo  nucleophilic  substitution  with  hydrogen  halides  to  yield alkyl halides. Dehydration of alcohols gives alkenes. On oxidation, primary alcohols yield  aldehydes  with  mild  oxidising  agents  and  carboxylic  acids  with  strong oxidising  agents  while  secondary  alcohols  yield  ketones.  Tertiary  alcohols  are resistant  to  oxidation. The  presence  of  –OH  group  in  phenols  activates  the  aromatic  ring  towards  electrophilic  substitution   and  directs  the  incoming  group  to   ortho   and   para  positions  due  to  resonance  effect.   Reimer-Tiemann  reaction   of  phenol  yields salicylaldehyde.  In  presence  of  sodium  hydroxide,  phenol  generates  phenoxide ion  which  is  even  more  reactive  than  phenol.

The  boiling  points  of  ethers  resemble  those  of  alkanes  while  their solubility  is  comparable  to  those  of  alcohols  having  same  molecular  mass.

In  aldehydes,  the  carbonyl  group  is  bonded  to  a carbon and hydrogen while in the ketones, it is bonded to two carbon atoms. The carbonyl compounds in which carbon  of  carbonyl  group  is  bonded  to  carbon  or hydrogen  and  oxygen  of  hydroxyl  moiety  (-OH)  are known as carboxylic acids, while in compounds where  carbon is attached to carbon or hydrogen and nitrogen of  -NH 2   moiety  or  to  halogens  are  called  amides  and acyl  halides  respectively.  Esters  and  anhydrides  are derivatives of carboxylic acids. The general formulas of these classes of compounds are given below: "

They add fragrance and flavour to nature, for example, vanillin (from vanilla beans), salicylaldehyde (from meadow sweet) and cinnamaldehyde (from cinnamon) have very pleasant fragrances.  8.1.1 Nomenclature  I.   Aldehydes  and  ketones  Aldehydes and ketones are the simplest and most important carbonyl compounds. There are two systems of nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones.  (a) Common names  Aldehydes  and  ketones  are  often  called  by  their  common  names instead of IUPAC names. The common names of most aldehydes are derived from the common names of the corresponding carboxylic acids [Section 8.6.1] by replacing the ending – ic  of acid with aldehyde. At the same time, the names reflect the Latin or Greek term for the original source of the acid or aldehyde. The location of the substituent in the carbon chain is indicated by Greek letters  a ,  b ,  g ,  d , etc. The  a -carbon  being  the  one  directly  linked  to  the  aldehyde  group,   b - carbon the next, and so on.

The locations of substituents are indicated by Greek letters,  a   a¢ ,  b   b¢  and so on beginning  with  the  carbon  atoms  next  to  the  carbonyl  group, indicated as  aa¢ . Some ketones have historical common names, the  simplest  dimethyl  ketone  is  called  acetone.  Alkyl  phenyl ketones are usually named by adding the name of acyl group as prefix to the word phenone. For example  (b)   IUPAC names  The IUPAC names of open chain aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are  derived  from  the  names  of  the  corresponding  alkanes  by replacing the ending – e  with – al  and – one  respectively. In case of aldehydes the longest carbon chain is numbered starting from the carbon  of  the  aldehyde  group  while  in  case  of  ketones  the numbering begins from the end nearer to the carbonyl group. The substituents are prefixed in alphabetical order along with numerals indicating their positions in the carbon chain. The same applies to cyclic ketones, where the carbonyl carbon is numbered one. When the aldehyde group is attached to a ring, the suffix carbaldehyde is added after the full name of the cycloalkane. The numbering of the ring carbon atoms start from the carbon atom attached to the aldehyde  group.  The  name  of  the  simplest  aromatic  aldehyde carrying  the  aldehyde  group  on  a  benzene  ring  is benzenecarbaldehyde. However, the common name benzaldehyde is also accepted by IUPAC. Other aromatic aldehydes are hence named as substituted benzaldehydes. "

The fourth valence electron of carbon remains in its  p -orbital and forms a  p -bond with oxygen by overlap with  p -orbital of an oxygen. In addition, the oxygen atom also has two non bonding electron pairs. Thus, the carbonyl carbon and the three atoms attached to it lie in the same plane and the  p -electron cloud is above and below this plane. The bond angles are approximately 120° as expected of a trigonal coplanar structure (Figure 8.1).  8.1.2 Structure of the Carbonyl Group    Fig.8.1   Orbital diagram for the formation of carbonyl group  The  carbon-oxygen  double  bond  is  polarised  due  to  higher electronegativity  of  oxygen  relative  to  carbon.

Methanal  is  a  gas  at  room  temperature.  Ethanal  is  a  volatile  liquid. Other aldehydes and ketones are liquid or solid at room temperature. The  boiling  points  of  aldehydes  and  ketones  are  higher  than hydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular masses. It is due to weak molecular association in aldehydes and ketones arising out of the dipole-dipole interactions. Also, their boiling points are lower than those of alcohols of similar molecular masses due to absence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The following compounds of molecular masses 58 and 60 are ranked in order of increasing boiling points.  b.p.(K)   Molecular  Mass  n-Butane   273   58 Methoxyethane   281   60 Propanal   322   58 Acetone   329   58 Propan-1-ol   370   60  The lower members of aldehydes and ketones such as methanal, ethanal  and  propanone  are  miscible  with  water  in  all  proportions, because they form hydrogen bond with water. However, the solubility of aldehydes and ketones decreases rapidly on increasing the length of alkyl chain. All aldehydes and ketones are fairly  soluble  in  organic  solvents  like  benzene,  ether,  methanol, chloroform, etc. The lower aldehydes have sharp pungent odours. As the  size  of  the  molecule  increases,  the  odour  becomes  less  pungent and  more  fragrant.  In  fact,  many  naturally  occurring  aldehydes  and ketones are used in the blending of perfumes and flavouring agents.  8.3  Physical8.3  Physical8.3  Physical8.3  Physical8.3  Physical PropertiesProperties PropertiesPropertiesProperties  Arrange  the  following  compounds  in  the  increasing  order  of  their boiling points:  CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CHO, CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 OH, H 5 C 2 -O-C 2 H 5 , CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3  The molecular masses of these compounds are in the range of 72 to 74. Since only butan-1-ol molecules are associated due to extensive intermolecular  hydrogen  bonding,  therefore,  the  boiling  point  of butan-1-ol  would  be  the  highest.

The hybridisation of carbon changes from  sp 2  to  sp 3  in this  process,  and  a  tetrahedral  alkoxide  intermediate  is produced.

Explain your answer. The  carbon  atom  of  the  carbonyl  group  of  benzaldehyde  is  less electrophilic than carbon atom of the carbonyl group present in propanal. The polarity of the carbonyl group is reduced in benzaldehyde due to  resonance  as  shown  below  and hence it is less reactive than propanal.

Sterically,  the  presence  of  two  relatively  large substituents in ketones hinders the approach of nucleophile to  carbonyl  carbon  than  in  aldehydes  having  only  one  such substituent.  Electronically,  aldehydes  are  more  reactive  than ketones because two alkyl groups reduce the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon more effectively than in former.  8.4  Chemical8.4  Chemical8.4  Chemical8.4  Chemical8.4  Chemical ReactionsReactionsReactionsReactionsReactions "

The position of the  equilibrium lies  largely  to the  right  hand side  for  most aldehydes and to the left for most ketones due to steric reasons. The hydrogensulphite addition compound is water soluble and can be converted back to the original carbonyl compound by treating it with dilute mineral acid or alkali. Therefore, these are useful for separation and purification of aldehydes. (c)   Addition of Grignard reagents:    (refer Unit 7, Class XII).

Aldehydes are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids on treatment with common oxidising agents like nitric acid, potassium permanganate, potassium dichromate, etc. Even mild oxidising agents, mainly Tollens’ reagent and Fehlings’ reagent also oxidise aldehydes. Ketones are generally oxidised under vigorous conditions, i.e., strong oxidising agents and at elevated temperatures. Their oxidation involves carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic acids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone. The  mild  oxidising  agents  given  below  are  used  to  distinguish aldehydes from ketones:  (i)   Tollens’  test:     On  warming  an  aldehyde  with  freshly  prepared ammoniacal  silver  nitrate  solution  (Tollens’  reagent),  a  bright silver mirror is produced due to the formation of silver metal. The aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion. The reaction occurs in alkaline medium.

Fehling solution A is aqueous  copper  sulphate  and  Fehling  solution  B  is  alkaline sodium potassium tartarate (Rochelle salt). These two solutions are mixed in equal amounts before test. On heating an aldehyde with Fehling’s reagent, a reddish brown precipitate is obtained. Aldehydes  are  oxidised  to  corresponding  carboxylate  anion. Aromatic aldehydes do not respond to this test.  Bernhard Tollens (1841-1918) was a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Gottingen, Germany. "

The carboxyl group, consists of a  carbonyl  group attached to a  hydroxyl  group, hence its name  carboxyl . Carboxylic acids may be aliphatic (RCOOH) or aromatic (ArCOOH) depending on the group, alkyl or aryl, attached to carboxylic carbon. Large  number of carboxylic acids are found in nature. Some higher members of aliphatic carboxylic acids (C 12  – C 18 ) known as  fatty acids,  occur in natural fats as esters of glycerol. Carboxylic acids serve as starting material for several other important organic compounds such as anhydrides, esters, acid chlorides, amides, etc. Since carboxylic acids are amongst the earliest organic compounds to be isolated from nature, a large number of them are known by their common names. The common names end with the suffix – ic  acid and have been derived from Latin or Greek names of their natural sources. For  example,  formic  acid  (HCOOH)  was  first  obtained  from  red  ants (Latin:  formica  means ant), acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) from vinegar (Latin:  acetum , means vinegar), butyric acid (CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH) from rancid butter (Latin:  butyrum,  means butter). In  the  IUPAC  system,  aliphatic  carboxylic  acids  are  named  by replacing the ending – e  in the name of the corresponding alkane with –  oic  acid .  In  numbering  the  carbon  chain,  the  carboxylic  carbon  is numbered  one.  For  naming  compounds  containing  more  than  one carboxyl group, the alkyl chain leaving carboxyl groups is numbered and  the  number  of  carboxyl  groups  is  indicated  by  adding  the multiplicative prefix,  dicarboxylic acid ,  tricarboxylic acid,  etc. to the name of parent alkyl chain.   The position of –COOH groups are indicated by the arabic numeral before the multiplicative prefix.

The  higher acids are wax like solids and are practically odourless due to their low volatility. Carboxylic acids are higher boiling liquids  than  aldehydes,  ketones  and  even  alcohols  of comparable molecular masses. This is due to more extensive association  of  carboxylic  acid  molecules  through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds are not broken completely even in the vapour phase. In fact, most carboxylic acids exist as dimer in the vapour phase or in the aprotic solvents. Simple  aliphatic  carboxylic  acids  having  upto  four carbon atoms are miscible in water due to the formation of  hydrogen  bonds  with  water.

For convenience, the strength of an acid is generally indicated by its p K a  value rather than its  K a  value. p K a  =  –   log  K a  The p K a  of hydrochloric acid is –7.0, where as  p K a   of trifluoroacetic acid  (the  strongest  carboxylic  acid),  benzoic  acid  and  acetic  acid  are 0.23, 4.19 and 4.76, respectively. Smaller the p K a , the stronger the acid ( the better it is as a proton donor).  Strong  acids  have  p K a   values  <  1,  the  acids  with  p K a   values between 1 and 5 are considered to be moderately strong acids, weak acids  have  p K a    values  between  5  and  15,  and  extremely  weak  acids have  p K a    values  >15. Carboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids, but they are stronger acids than alcohols and many simple phenols (p K a  is ~16 for ethanol and 10 for phenol). In fact, carboxylic acids are amongst the most acidic organic  compounds  you  have  studied  so  far.  You  already  know  why phenols are more acidic than alcohols. The higher acidity of carboxylic acids as compared to phenols can be understood similarly. The conjugate base of carboxylic acid, a carboxylate ion, is stabilised by two equivalent resonance  structures  in  which  the  negative  charge  is  at  the  more electronegative oxygen atom. The conjugate base of phenol, a phenoxide ion, has non-equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge is  at  the  less  electronegative  carbon  atom.  Therefore,  resonance  in phenoxide ion is not as important as it is in carboxylate ion. Further, the negative charge is delocalised over two electronegative oxygen atoms in carboxylate ion whereas it is less effectively delocalised over one oxygen atom and less electronegative carbon atoms in phenoxide ion (Unit 7, Class XII). Thus, the carboxylate ion is more stabilised than phenoxide ion,  so carboxylic acids are more acidic than phenols.  Effect  of  substituents  on  the  acidity  of  carboxylic  acids:  Substituents may affect the stability of the conjugate base and thus, also  affect  the  acidity  of  the  carboxylic  acids.  Electron  withdrawing groups  increase  the  acidity  of  carboxylic  acids  by  stabilising  the conjugate  base  through  delocalisation  of  the  negative  charge  by inductive and/or resonance effects. Conversely, electron donating groups decrease the acidity by destabilising the conjugate base.

Aromatic  carboxylic  acids  are  also  prepared  by  side-chain  oxidation of  alkylbenzenes.  Carboxylic  acids  are  considerably  more  acidic  than  alcohols  and most of simple phenols. Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with LiAlH 4 , or  better  with  diborane  in  ether  solution  and  also  undergo   a -halogenation  with  Cl 2  and  Br 2   in  the  presence  of  red  phosphorus  ( Hell-Volhard  Zelinsky  reaction ).

In nature, they occur among proteins, vitamins, alkaloids and hormones. Synthetic examples include polymers, dye  stuffs  and  drugs.  Two  biologically  active compounds,  namely  adrenaline  and  ephedrine,  both containing secondary amino group, are used to increase blood pressure. Novocain, a synthetic amino compound, is used as an anaesthetic in dentistry. Benadryl, a well known antihistaminic drug also contains tertiary amino group.  Quaternary  ammonium  salts  are  used  as surfactants. Diazonium salts are intermediates in the preparation  of  a    variety  of  aromatic  compounds including dyes. In this Unit, you will learn about amines and diazonium salts.  I. AMINES  Amines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia, obtained  by  replacement  of  one,  two  or  all  the  three hydrogen atoms by alkyl and/or aryl groups. For example: Like ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and carries an unshared pair of electrons.  Nitrogen orbitals in amines are therefore,  sp 3  hybridised and the geometry of amines is pyramidal. Each of  the three  sp 3  hybridised orbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or carbon depending upon the composition of the amines. The fourth orbital of nitrogen in all amines contains an unshared  pair  of  electrons.

Amines are classified as primary (1 o ),  secondary  (2 o ) and tertiary (3 o ) depending upon the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or aryl groups in ammonia molecule.  If one hydrogen atom of ammonia is replaced by R or Ar , we get RNH 2  or ArNH 2 , a primary amine (1 o ). If two hydrogen atoms of ammonia or one hydrogen atom of R-NH 2  are replaced  by  another  alkyl/aryl(R ’ )  group,    what  would  you  get?  You get  R-NHR’,  secondary  amine.    The  second  alkyl/aryl  group  may  be same or different. Replacement of another hydrogen atom by alkyl/aryl group leads to the formation of tertiary amine. Amines are said to be ‘simple’  when  all  the  alkyl  or  aryl  groups  are  the  same,  and  ‘mixed’ when they are different. In  common  system,  an  aliphatic  amine  is  named  by  prefixing  alkyl group to amine, i.e., alkylamine as one word (e.g., methylamine).  In secondary and tertiary amines, when two or more groups are the same, the  prefix  di  or  tri  is  appended  before  the  name  of  alkyl  group.    In IUPAC system, primary amines are named as  alkanamines . The name is  derived  by  replacement  of  ‘e’  of  alkane  by  the  word  amine.  For example, CH 3 NH 2  is named as methanamine. In case, more than one amino group is present at different positions in the parent chain, their positions are specified by giving numbers to the carbon atoms bearing –NH 2  groups and suitable prefix such as di, tri, etc. is attached to the amine. The letter ‘e’ of the suffix of the hydrocarbon part is retained. For example, H 2 N–CH 2 –CH 2 –NH 2  is named as ethane-1, 2-diamine. To name secondary and tertiary amines, we use locant N to designate substituent attached to a nitrogen atom.

Reduction  of  nitro  compounds  Nitro compounds are reduced to amines by passing hydrogen gas in the presence of finely divided nickel, palladium or platinum and also by reduction with metals in acidic medium. Nitroalkanes can also be similarly reduced to the corresponding alkanamines. Reduction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is preferred because FeCl 2  formed gets hydrolysed to release hydrochloric acid during the reaction. Thus, only a small amount of hydrochloric acid is required to initiate the reaction.  2. Ammonolysis  of  alkyl  halides  You have read (Unit 6, Class XII) that the carbon - halogen bond in alkyl or benzyl halides can be easily cleaved by a nucleophile.  Hence, an alkyl or benzyl halide on reaction with an ethanolic solution of ammonia undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the halogen atom is replaced by an amino (–NH 2 ) group. This process of cleavage  of  the  C–X  bond  by  ammonia  molecule  is  known  as  ammonolysis .  The reaction is carried out in a sealed tube at 373 K.

Aniline  and  other  arylamines  are  usually  colourless  but  get coloured on storage due to atmospheric oxidation. Lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water because they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases with increase in molar mass of amines due to increase in size of the hydrophobic alkyl part. Higher amines are essentially insoluble in water.

Amine salts are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents like ether. This reaction is the basis for the separation of amines from the non basic organic compounds insoluble in water. The reaction of amines with mineral acids to form ammonium salts shows that these are basic in nature. Amines have an unshared pair of electrons on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as  Lewis base.  Basic character of amines can be better understood in terms of their  K b  and p K b  values as explained below:  K   =            3 2   2  R   O H  R   H NH NH   O                          2 or   [H   O] K   =       3 2  O H N H   H R R   N                         or   b K   =        3 2  ON H NH  H R R                          p K b   =  –log   K b  Larger the value of  K b  or smaller the value of p K b , stronger is the base. The p K b  values of few amines are given in Table 9.3. p K b  value of ammonia is 4.75. Aliphatic amines are stronger bases than ammonia due to +I effect of alkyl groups leading to high electron density on the nitrogen atom.  Their p K b  values lie in the range of 3 to 4.22.  On  the  other  hand,  aromatic  amines  are  weaker  bases  than ammonia due to the electron withdrawing nature of the aryl group.

                    "content": "Chemistry  You may find some discrepancies while trying to interpret the  K b  values  of  amines  on  the  basis  of    +I  or  –I  effect  of  the  substituents present in amines.  Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like solvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength of amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following paragraphs.  Structure-basicity  relationship  of  amines  Basicity of amines is related to their structure.  Basic character of an amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by accepting a proton from the acid.  The more stable the cation is relative to the amine, more basic is the amine.  (a) Alkanamines  versus  ammonia  Let us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with a proton to compare their basicity. Due to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it (R) pushes electrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron pair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover, the substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised due to dispersal of the positive charge by the +I effect of the alkyl group.    Hence,  alkylamines  are  stronger  bases  than  ammonia. Thus,  the  basic  nature  of  aliphatic  amines  should  increase  with increase in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in the gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous phase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine >  primary  amine  >  NH 3 .  The  trend  is  not  regular  in  the  aqueous state  as  evident  by  their  p K b   values  given  in  Table  9.3.  In  the aqueous phase, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilised not only by electron releasing effect of the alkyl group (+I) but also by solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion, lesser will be the solvation and the less stabilised is the ion. The order of stability of ions are as follows:  Decreasing  order  of    extent  of  H-bonding  in  water  and  order  of stability of ions by solvation. "

                    "content": "Amines  Greater is the stability of the substituted ammonium cation, stronger should be the corresponding amine as a base. Thus, the order of basicity of aliphatic amines should be: primary > secondary > tertiary, which is opposite to the inductive effect based order.   Secondly, when the alkyl group is small, like –CH 3  group, there is no steric hindrance to H-bonding. In case the alkyl group is bigger than CH 3  group, there will be steric hinderance to H-bonding. Therefore,  the change of nature of the alkyl group, e.g., from –CH 3  to –C 2 H 5  results in change of the order of  basic  strength.  Thus,  there  is  a  subtle  interplay  of  the  inductive effect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which decides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state.  The order of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl substituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows: (C 2 H 5 ) 2 NH > (C 2 H 5 ) 3 N > C 2 H 5 NH 2  > NH 3  (CH 3 ) 2 NH > CH 3 NH 2  > (CH 3 ) 3 N > NH 3  (b)   Arylamines  versus  ammonia  p K b  value of aniline is quite high.  Why is it so?  It is because in aniline or other arylamines, the -NH 2  group is attached directly to the benzene ring. It results in the unshared electron pair on nitrogen atom to be in conjugation with the benzene ring and thus making it less available for protonation.  If you write different resonating structures  of  aniline,    you  will  find  that  aniline  is  a  resonance hybrid of the following five structures. On the other hand, anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton can have only two resonating structures (kekule). We know that greater the number of resonating structures, greater is  the  stability.  Thus  you  can  infer  that  aniline  (five  resonating structures)  is  more  stable  than  anilinium  ion.  Hence,  the  proton acceptability or the basic nature of aniline or other aromatic amines would be less than that of ammonia.  In case of substituted aniline, it is observed that electron releasing groups like –OCH 3 , –CH 3  increase basic strength whereas electron withdrawing groups like  –NO 2 , –SO 3 H, –COOH, –X decrease it.

This  reaction  is  known  as  acylation.    You  can  consider this reaction as the replacement of hydrogen atom of –NH 2  or  > N–H group by the acyl group. The products obtained by acylation reaction are known as amides.

Reaction  with  nitrous  acid  Three classes of amines react differently with nitrous acid which is prepared  in situ  from a mineral acid and sodium nitrite.

Quantitative evolution of nitrogen is used in estimation of amino acids and proteins. (b)   Aromatic  amines  react  with  nitrous  acid  at  low  temperatures (273-278 K) to form diazonium salts, a very important class of compounds used for synthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds discussed in Section 9.7.

(a) The reaction of benzenesulphonyl chloride with primary amine yields N-ethylbenzenesulphonyl amide. The  hydrogen  attached  to  nitrogen  in  sulphonamide  is  strongly acidic  due  to  the  presence  of  strong  electron  withdrawing  sulphonyl group. Hence, it is soluble in alkali.

This property of amines reacting with benzenesulphonyl chloride in  a  different  manner  is  used  for  the  distinction  of  primary, secondary and tertiary amines and also for the separation of a mixture  of  amines.  However,  these  days  benzenesulphonyl chloride is replaced by  p -toluenesulphonyl chloride.  7. Electrophilic  substitution  You  have  read  earlier  that  aniline  is  a  resonance  hybrid  of  five structures.  Where  do  you  find  the  maximum  electron  density  in these  structures?   Ortho-   and   para- positions  to  the  –NH 2   group become centres of high electron density.  Thus –NH 2  group is  ortho  and  para  directing and a powerful activating group.  (a) Bromination:    Aniline  reacts  with  bromine  water  at  room temperature to give a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline. The main problem encountered during electrophilic substitution reactions of aromatic amines is that of their very high reactivity. Substitution tends to occur at  ortho-  and  para- positions.  If we have  to  prepare  monosubstituted    aniline  derivative,  how  can the activating effect of –NH 2  group be controlled ?  This can be done  by  protecting  the  -NH 2   group  by  acetylation  with  acetic anhydride, then carrying out the desired substitution followed by hydrolysis of the substituted amide to the substituted amine. The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen of acetanilide  interacts with oxygen atom due to resonance as shown below: "

Therefore,  activating effect of –NHCOCH 3  group is less than that of amino group.  (b)   Nitration:   Direct  nitration  of  aniline  yields  tarry  oxidation products  in  addition  to  the  nitro  derivatives.  Moreover,  in  the strongly  acidic  medium,  aniline  is  protonated  to  form  the anilinium ion which is  meta  directing. That is why besides the  ortho  and  para  derivatives, significant amount of  meta  derivative is also formed. However, by protecting the –NH 2  group by acetylation reaction with acetic anhydride, the nitration  reaction can be controlled and the  p -nitro derivative can be obtained as the major product.  (c)   Sulphonation :   Aniline reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid to  form  anilinium  hydrogensulphate  which  on  heating  with sulphuric acid at 453-473K produces p-aminobenzene sulphonic acid, commonly known as sulphanilic acid, as the major product. Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction (alkylation and acetylation) due to salt formation with aluminium chloride, the Lewis acid, which is used as a catalyst. Due to this, nitrogen of aniline  acquires  positive  charge  and  hence  acts  as  a  strong deactivating group for further reaction. "

A.

This type of reaction is known as coupling reaction. Similarly the reaction of diazonium salt with aniline yields  p -aminoazobenzene. This is an example of electrophilic substitution reaction. From the above reactions, it is clear that the diazonium salts are very good intermediates for the introduction of –F, –Cl, –Br, –I, –CN, –OH, –NO 2  groups into the aromatic ring. Aryl fluorides and iodides cannot be prepared by direct halogenation.

The most amazing thing about a living system is that it is  composed  of  non-living  atoms  and  molecules.  The pursuit of knowledge of what goes on chemically within a living system falls in the domain of  biochemistry . Living systems are made up of various complex biomolecules like  carbohydrates,  proteins,  nucleic  acids,  lipids,  etc. Proteins and carbohydrates are essential constituents of our  food.  These  biomolecules  interact  with  each  other and constitute the molecular logic of life processes. In addition,  some  simple  molecules  like  vitamins  and mineral salts also play an important role in the functions of organisms.  Structures and functions of some of these biomolecules are discussed in this Unit.

Some  common examples of carbohydrates are cane sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of them have a general formula, C x (H 2 O) y , and were considered as hydrates of carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example, the molecular formula of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) fits into this general formula, C 6 (H 2 O) 6 . But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be classified as carbohydrates. For example acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) fits into this  general  formula,  C 2 (H 2 O) 2   but  is  not  a  carbohydrate.  Similarly, rhamnose, C 6 H 12 O 5  is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition. A large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific  functional  groups.  Chemically,   the  carbohydrates  may  be  defined  as optically  active  polyhydroxy  aldehydes  or  ketones  or  the  compounds which  produce  such  units  on  hydrolysis .  Some  of  the  carbohydrates, which  are  sweet  in  taste,  are  also  called  sugars.

Carbohydrates  are  classified  on  the  basis  of  their  behaviour  on hydrolysis. They have been broadly divided into following three groups. (i)   Monosaccharides :   A carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolysed further to give simpler unit of polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone is called a monosaccharide. About 20 monosaccharides are known to occur in nature. Some common examples are glucose, fructose, ribose, etc. (ii)   Oligosaccharides :   Carbohydrates  that  yield  two  to  ten monosaccharide units, on hydrolysis, are called oligosaccharides. They are further classified as disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides, etc., depending upon the number of monosaccharides, they provide on hydrolysis. Amongst these the most common are disaccharides. The two monosaccharide units obtained on hydrolysis of a disaccharide may be same or different. For example, one molecule of sucrose on hydrolysis gives one molecule of glucose and  one molecule of fructose whereas maltose gives two molecules of  only glucose. (iii)   Polysaccharides :   Carbohydrates  which  yield  a  large  number  of monosaccharide  units  on  hydrolysis  are  called  polysaccharides. Some  common  examples  are  starch,  cellulose,  glycogen,  gums, etc.  Polysaccharides  are  not  sweet  in  taste,  hence  they  are  also called non-sugars. The carbohydrates may also be classified as either reducing or non- reducing  sugars.  All  those  carbohydrates  which  reduce  Fehling’s solution and Tollens’ reagent are referred to as reducing sugars. All monosaccharides whether aldose or ketose are  reducing sugars.  Monosaccharides are further classified on the basis of number of carbon atoms and the functional group present in them. If a monosaccharide contains an aldehyde group, it is known as an aldose and if it contains a  keto  group,  it  is  known  as  a  ketose.  Number  of  carbon  atoms constituting the monosaccharide is also introduced in the name as is evident from the examples given in Table 10.1  10.1.1 Classification of Carbohydrates 10.1.2 Monosaccharides  3   Triose   Aldotriose   Ketotriose 4   Tetrose   Aldotetrose   Ketotetrose 5   Pentose   Aldopentose   Ketopentose 6   Hexose   Aldohexose   Ketohexose 7   Heptose   Aldoheptose   Ketoheptose  Carbon  atoms   General  term   Aldehyde   Ketone  Table  10.1:  Different  Types  of  Monosaccharides  Glucose occurs freely in nature as well as in the combined form.

On prolonged heating with HI, it forms n-hexane, suggesting that all the six carbon atoms are linked in a straight chain. 3.   Glucose reacts with hydroxylamine to form an oxime and adds a molecule of hydrogen cyanide to give cyanohydrin. These reactions confirm the presence of a carbonyl group (>C = O) in glucose. 4.   Glucose gets oxidised to six carbon carboxylic acid (gluconic acid) on  reaction  with  a  mild  oxidising  agent  like  bromine  water.  This indicates that the carbonyl group is present as an aldehydic group.  CHO (CH   ) 4 OH   (CH   ) 4 OH CH 2 OH   CH 2 OH  Br   water 2  COOH  Gluconic acid 5.

The meaning of D– and L– notations is as follows. The letters ‘D’ or ‘L’ before the name of any compound indicate the relative configuration of a particular stereoisomer of a compound with respect to configuration of some other compound, configuration of which is known. In the case of carbohydrates, this refers to their relation with a particular isomer of glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde contains one asymmetric carbon atom and exists in two enantiomeric forms as shown below. (+) Isomer of glyceraldehyde has ‘D’ configuration. It means that when its structural formula is written on paper following specific conventions which you will study in higher classes, the –OH group lies on right hand side in the structure.

Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not give Schiff’s test and it does not form the hydrogensulphite addition product with NaHSO 3 . 2.   The  pentaacetate  of  glucose  does  not  react  with  hydroxylamine indicating the absence of free —CHO group. 3.   Glucose is found to exist in two different crystalline forms which are named as  a  and  b . The  a -form of glucose (m.p. 419 K) is obtained by crystallisation from concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K while the  b -form (m.p. 423 K) is obtained by crystallisation from hot and saturated aqueous solution at 371 K. This behaviour could not be explained by the open chain structure ( I ) for glucose. It was proposed that one of the —OH groups may add to the —CHO group and form a cyclic hemiacetal structure. It was found that glucose forms a six-membered ring in which —OH at C-5 is involved in ring formation. This explains the absence of —CHO group and also existence of glucose in two forms as shown below. These two cyclic forms exist in equilibrium with open chain structure.

The two monosaccharides are joined together by an oxide linkage formed by the loss of a water molecule. Such a linkage between  two  monosaccharide  units  through  oxygen  atom  is  called  glycosidic  linkage.  In disaccharides, if the reducing groups of monosaccharides i.e., aldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, these are non-reducing sugars, e.g., sucrose. On the other hand, sugars in which these functional groups are free, are called reducing sugars, for example, maltose and lactose.  (i)   Sucrose :    One  of  the  common  disaccharides  is   sucrose   which  on hydrolysis gives equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-) fructose.  10.1.3 Disaccharides  These  two  monosaccharides  are  held  together  by  a  glycosidic linkage between C1 of  a -D-glucose and C2 of  b -D-fructose. Since the  reducing  groups  of  glucose  and  fructose  are  involved  in glycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non reducing sugar. Sucrose  is  dextrorotatory  but  after  hydrolysis  gives dextrorotatory  glucose  and  laevorotatory  fructose.  Since  the laevorotation  of  fructose  (–92.4°)  is  more  than  dextrorotation  of glucose (+ 52.5°), the mixture is laevorotatory. Thus, hydrolysis of sucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation, from dextro (+) to laevo (–) and the product is named as  invert sugar . (ii)   Maltose :    Another  disaccharide,  maltose  is  composed  of  two  a -D-glucose units in which C1 of one glucose (I) is linked to C4 of  another  glucose  unit  (II).  The  free  aldehyde  group  can  be produced at C1 of second glucose in solution and it shows reducing properties so it is a reducing sugar. "

They  are  also  required  for growth  and  maintenance  of  body.  The  word  protein  is  derived  from Greek word, “ proteios ” which means primary or of prime importance. All  proteins  are  polymers  of   a -amino  acids. Amino  acids  contain  amino  (–NH 2 )  and  carboxyl  (–COOH)  functional groups.  Depending  upon  the  relative  position  of  amino  group  with respect to carboxyl group, the amino acids can be classified  as   a ,   b ,   g ,   d   and  so  on.  Only   a -amino acids are obtained on hydrolysis of proteins. They may contain other functional groups also. All   a -amino  acids  have  trivial  names,  which usually reflect the property of that compound or its source. Glycine is so named since it has sweet taste (in Greek  glykos  means sweet) and tyrosine was first obtained from cheese (in Greek,  tyros  means cheese.)

These  are water-soluble,  high  melting  solids  and  behave  like  salts  rather  than simple amines or carboxylic acids. This behaviour is due to the presence of both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino group) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous solution,  the  carboxyl  group  can  lose  a  proton and amino group can accept a proton, giving rise to  a  dipolar  ion  known  as   zwitter  ion .  This  is neutral  but  contains  both  positive  and  negative charges. In zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as they react both with acids and bases. Except  glycine,  all  other  naturally  occurring   a -amino  acids  are optically  active,  since  the   a -carbon  atom  is  asymmetric.  These  exist both in ‘D’ and ‘L’ forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have L-configuration. L-Aminoacids are represented by writing the –NH 2  group on left hand side. You have already read that proteins are the polymers of  a -amino acids and  they  are  connected  to  each  other  by   peptide  bond   or   peptide linkage.   Chemically,  peptide  linkage  is  an  amide  formed  between –COOH group and –NH 2  group. The reaction between two molecules of similar or different amino acids, proceeds through the combination of the amino group of one molecule with the carboxyl group of the other. This results in the elimination of a water molecule and formation of a peptide bond –CO–NH–. The product of the reaction is  called  a  dipeptide  because  it  is  made  up  of  two amino acids. For example, when carboxyl group of glycine combines with the amino group of alanine we get a  dipeptide , glycylalanine. If a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a  tripeptide . A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide linkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective products  are  known  as   tetrapeptide,  pentapeptide  or  hexapeptide , respectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then the products are called  polypeptides . A polypeptide with more than hundred amino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10,000u is called a protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is not very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called proteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such as insulin which contains 51 amino acids.  Proteins   can  be  classified  into  two  types  on  the  basis  of  their molecular shape.  (a)   Fibrous  proteins  When  the  polypeptide  chains  run  parallel  and  are  held  together  by hydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre– like structure is formed. Such proteins are generally insoluble in water. Some common examples are keratin (present in hair, wool, silk) and myosin (present in muscles), etc.  10.2.3 Structure of Proteins "

These are usually soluble in water. Insulin and albumins are the common examples of globular proteins. Structure and shape of proteins can be studied at four different levels, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary, each level being more complex than the previous one.  (i)   Primary  structure  of  proteins :  Proteins  may  have one or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a protein  has  amino  acids  linked  with  each  other  in  a specific sequence and it is this sequence of amino acids that is said to be the primary structure of that protein. Any change in this primary structure i.e., the sequence of amino acids creates a different protein.  (ii)   Secondary  structure  of  proteins :   The  secondary structure of protein refers to the shape in which a long polypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in two  different  types  of  structures  viz.   a -helix  and  b -pleated  sheet  structure.  These  structures  arise  due to the regular folding of the backbone of the polypeptide chain  due  to  hydrogen  bonding  between     and –NH–  groups  of  the  peptide  bond.  a -Helix is one of the most common ways in which a polypeptide chain forms all possible hydrogen bonds by  twisting  into  a  right  handed  screw  (helix)  with  the –NH group of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the  C   O  of an adjacent turn of the helix as shown in Fig.10.1. In  b -pleated sheet structure all peptide chains are stretched out to nearly maximum extension and then laid  side  by  side  which  are  held  together  by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The structure resembles the pleated folds of drapery and therefore is known as  b -pleated sheet.  (iii) Tertiary  structure  of  proteins :   The  tertiary structure of proteins represents overall folding of the polypeptide chains i.e., further folding of the secondary structure. It gives rise to two major molecular shapes viz.  fibrous  and  globular.  The  main  forces  which stabilise  the  2°  and  3°  structures  of  proteins  are hydrogen bonds, disulphide linkages, van der Waals and electrostatic forces of attraction.  (iv)  Quaternary  structure  of  proteins :   Some  of  the proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide chains  referred  to  as  sub-units.  The  spatial arrangement of these subunits with respect to each other is known as quaternary structure. "

An  example  is  the  digestion  of  food,  absorption  of appropriate molecules and ultimately production of energy. This process involves a sequence of reactions and all these reactions occur in the body under very mild conditions. This occurs with the help of certain biocatalysts  called   enzymes.   Almost  all  the  enzymes  are  globular proteins. Enzymes are very specific for a particular reaction and for a particular substrate. They are generally named after the compound or class of compounds upon which they work. For example, the enzyme that catalyses hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is named as  maltase .  12   22   11   6   12   6  Maltase Maltose   G lucose C   H   O   2 C   H   O  Sometimes enzymes are also named after the reaction, where they are  used.  For  example,  the  enzymes  which  catalyse  the  oxidation  of one  substrate  with  simultaneous  reduction  of  another  substrate  are named  as   oxidoreductase   enzymes.  The  ending  of  the  name  of  an enzyme is  -ase . Enzymes are needed only in small quantities for the progress of a reaction. Similar to the action of chemical catalysts, enzymes are said to reduce the magnitude of activation energy. For example, activation energy for acid hydrolysis of sucrose is 6.22 kJ mol –1 , while the activation energy is only 2.15 kJ mol –1  when hydrolysed by the enzyme, sucrase. Mechanism for the enzyme action has been discussed. It has been observed that certain organic compounds are required in small amounts in our diet but their deficiency causes specific diseases. These compounds are called  vitamins.  Most of the vitamins cannot be synthesised in our body but plants can synthesise almost all of them, so they are considered as essential food factors. However, the bacteria of  the  gut  can  produce  some  of  the  vitamins  required  by  us.  All  the vitamins are generally available in our diet. Different vitamins belong to  various  chemical  classes  and  it  is  difficult  to  define  them  on  the basis of structure. They are generally regarded as  organic compounds required  in  the  diet  in  small  amounts  to  perform  specific biological functions for normal maintenance of optimum growth 10.3.1 Mechanism of Enzyme Action  10.4  Vitamins10.4  Vitamins10.4  Vitamins10.4  Vitamins10.4  Vitamins 10.3  Enzymes10.3  Enzymes10.3  Enzymes10.3  Enzymes10.3  Enzymes "

The term “ Vitamine ” was coined from the word vital + amine since the earlier identified compounds had amino groups. Later work showed that most of them did not contain amino groups, so the letter ‘e’ was dropped and the term  vitamin  is used these days. Vitamins are classified into two groups depending upon their solubility in water or fat. (i)   Fat  soluble  vitamins :   Vitamins  which  are  soluble  in  fat  and  oils but insoluble in water are kept in this group. These are vitamins A, D, E and K. They are stored in liver and adipose (fat storing)  tissues. (ii)   Water soluble vitamins :   B group vitamins and vitamin C are soluble in water so they are grouped together.

He  is  best  known  for his  discovery  of  the  structure  of  DNA  for  which  he  shared  with Francis  Crick  and  Maurice  Wilkins  the  1962  Nobel    prize  in Physiology  and  Medicine.  They  proposed  that  DNA  molecule  takes the  shape  of  a  double  helix,  an  elegantly  simple  structure  that resembles  a  gently  twisted  ladder.  The  rails  of  the  ladder  are made of alternating units of phosphate and the sugar deoxyribose; the  rungs  are  each  composed  of  a  pair  of    purine/  pyrimidine  bases.  This research  laid  the  foundation  for  the  emerging  field  of   molecular  biology .  The complementary  pairing  of  nucleotide  bases  explains  how  identical  copies  of parental  DNA  pass  on  to  two  daughter  cells.  This  research  launched  a  revolution in  biology  that  led  to  modern  recombinant  DNA  techniques.  Complete hydrolysis of DNA (or RNA) yields a pentose sugar, phosphoric acid and nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds (called bases).

DNA is exclusively responsible for maintaining the identity of different species of organisms over millions of years. A DNA  molecule  is  capable  of  self  duplication  during  cell  division  and identical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. Another important function of nucleic acids is the protein synthesis in the cell. Actually, the proteins are synthesised by various RNA molecules in the cell but the message for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA. Hormones are molecules that act as intercellular messengers. These are produced by endocrine glands in the body and are poured directly in the blood stream which transports them to the site of action. In terms of chemical nature, some of these are steroids, e.g., estrogens and  androgens;  some  are  poly  peptides  for  example  insulin  and endorphins  and  some  others  are  amino  acid  derivatives  such  as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Hormones have several functions in the body. They help to maintain the balance of biological activities in the body. The role of insulin in keeping the blood glucose level within the narrow limit is an example of this function. Insulin is released in response to the rapid rise in blood glucose level. On the other hand hormone glucagon tends to increase the glucose level in the blood.  The two hormones together regulate the glucose level in  the  blood.

Low level of iodine in the diet may lead to hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid gland. This condition is largely being controlled by adding sodium iodide to commercial table salt (“Iodised” salt).   Steroid hormones are produced by adrenal cortex and gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females). Hormones released by the adrenal cortex play  very  important  role  in  the  functions  of  the  body.  For  example, glucocorticoids  control  the  carbohydrate  metabolism,  modulate inflammatory  reactions,  and  are  involved  in  reactions  to  stress.  The mineralocorticoids control the level of excretion of water and salt by the kidney. If adrenal cortex does not function properly then one of the results may be Addison’s disease characterised by hypoglycemia, weakness and increased susceptibility to stress. The disease is fatal unless it is treated by glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Hormones released by gonads are responsible for development of secondary sex characters. Testosterone is the major sex hormone produced in males. It is responsible for development of secondary male characteristics (deep voice, facial hair, general physical constitution) and estradiol is the main female sex hormone. It is responsible for development of secondary female characteristics and participates in the control of menstrual cycle. Progesterone is responsible for preparing the uterus for implantation of fertilised egg.

SummarySummary SummarySummarySummary  Carbohydrates  are optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or molecules which provide  such  units  on  hydrolysis.  They  are  broadly  classified  into  three  groups  —  monosaccharides ,   disaccharides   and   polysaccharides .  Glucose,  the  most  important source  of  energy  for  mammals,    is  obtained  by  the  digestion  of  starch.  Monosaccharides are  held  together  by  glycosidic  linkages  to  form  disaccharides  or  polysaccharides.  Proteins   are  the   polymers   of  about  twenty  different   aaaaa -amino  acids   which  are linked  by  peptide  bonds.  Ten  amino  acids  are  called  essential  amino  acids  because they cannot be synthesised by our body, hence must be provided through diet. Proteins perform  various  structural  and  dynamic  functions  in  the  organisms.  Proteins  which contain  only   a -amino  acids  are  called  simple  proteins.    The   secondary   or   tertiary structure  of  proteins   get  disturbed  on  change  of  pH  or  temperature  and  they  are  not able  to  perform  their  functions.  This  is  called   denaturation  of  proteins .  Enzymes  are  biocatalysts   which  speed  up  the  reactions  in  biosystems.  They  are  very  specific  and selective  in  their  action  and  chemically  majority  of   enzymes   are  proteins.  Vitamins   are  accessory  food  factors  required  in  the  diet.  They  are  classified  as fat  soluble  (A,  D,  E  and  K)  and  water  soluble  ( B   group  and  C).  Deficiency  of  vitamins leads  to  many  diseases. "

The use of polymers  in the manufacture of  plastic  buckets,  cups  and  saucers,  children’s  toys, packaging bags, synthetic clothing materials, automobile tyres, gears and seals, electrical insulating materials and machine parts has completely revolutionised the daily life  as  well  as  the  industrial  scenario.  Indeed,  the polymers are the backbone of four major industries viz. plastics, elastomers, fibres and paints and varnishes. The word ‘polymer’ is coined from two Greek words:  poly   means  many  and   mer   means  unit  or  part.  The term polymer is defined as very large molecules having high molecular mass (10 3 -10 7 u). These are also referred to as  macromolecules,  which are formed by joining of repeating structural units on a large scale. The repeating structural  units  are  derived  from  some  simple  and reactive molecules known as monomers and are linked to  each  other  by  covalent  bonds.  The  process  of formation  of  polymers  from  respective  monomers  is called  polymerisation .  After  studying  this  Unit,  you  will  be able to  •   explain  the  terms  -  monomer, polymer    and  polymerisation  and appreciate  their  importance;  •   distinguish  between  various classes  of  polymers  and  different types  of  polymerisation  processes;  •   appreciate  the  formation  of polymers  from  mono-  and  bi- functional    monomer    molecules;  •   describe  the  preparation  of  some important  synthetic  polymers  and their  properties;  •   appreciate  the  importance  of polymers  in  daily  life.

Semi-synthetic  polymers  Cellulose  derivatives  as  cellulose  acetate  (rayon)  and  cellulose nitrate, etc. are the usual examples of this sub category.  3. Synthetic  polymers  A  variety  of  synthetic  polymers  as  plastic  (polythene),  synthetic fibres  (nylon  6,6)  and  synthetic  rubbers  (Buna  -  S)  are  examples of    man-made  polymers  extensively  used  in  daily  life  as  well  as in industry. Polymers can also be classified on the basis of their structure, molecular forces or modes of polymerisation. There are two broad types of polymerisation reactions,  i.e. , the addition or  chain  growth  polymerisation  and  condensation  or  step  growth polymerisation. In  this  type  of  polymerisation,  the  molecules  of  the  same  monomer  or diferent monomers add together on a large scale to form a polymer. The monomers used are unsaturated compounds,  e.g. , alkenes, alkadienes and their derivatives. This mode of polymerisation leads to an increase  in chain length and chain growth can take place through the formation  of either free radicals or ionic species. However, the free radical governed addition or chain growth polymerisation is the most common mode.  1. Free  radical  mechanism  A variety of alkenes or dienes and their derivatives are polymerised in the presence of a free radical generating initiator   (catalyst)  like benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, tert-butyl peroxide, etc. For example, the  polymerisation  of  ethene  to  polythene  consists  of    heating  or exposing to light a mixture of ethene with a small amount  of  benzoyl peroxide  initiator. The process starts with the addition of phenyl free radical  formed  by  the  peroxide  to  the  ethene  double  bond  thus generating  a  new  and  larger  free  radical.  This  step  is  called   chain initiating step . As this radical reacts with another molecule of ethene, another bigger sized radical is formed. The repetition of this sequence with new and bigger radicals carries the reaction forward and the step is termed as  chain propagating  step . Ultimately, at some stage the product radical  thus formed reacts with another radical to form the polymerised product. This step is called the  chain terminating step . The  sequence  of  steps  involved  in  the  formation  of  polythene  are depicted as follows:  Chain  initiation  steps  15.2.1.1 Mechanism  of Addition Polymerisation  1 5 . 21 5 . 2  1 5 . 2 1 5 . 2 1 5 . 2  Types  ofTypes  ofTypes  ofTypes  ofTypes  of PolymerisationPolymerisationPolymerisationPolymerisationPolymerisation ReactionsReactions ReactionsReactionsReactions  15.2.1 Addition Polymerisation or Chain Growth Polymerisation  15.1   What are polymers ?

High density polythene (HDP) thus produced, consists of linear molecules  as  shown  below  and  has  a  high  density  due  to close packing. Such polymers are also called linear polymers.

For  example, butadiene - styrene copolymer is quite tough and is a good substitute for natural rubber. It is used for the manufacture of  autotyres,  floortiles,  footwear  components,  cable  insulation, etc.  1. Natural  rubber  Rubber    is    a    natural    polymer    and  possesses  elastic properties.  It    is  also  termed  as  elastomeric  polymer.  In elastomeric polymers, the polymer chains are held together by the weak intermolecular forces. These weak binding forces permit the polymer to be stretched. A  few ‘crosslinks’ are introduced in between the chains, which help the polymer to retract to its original  position  after  the  force is released. Rubber has a variety of uses. It is  manufactured from rubber latex  which  is  a  colloidal  dispersion  of  rubber  in  water.  This latex is obtained from the rubber tree which is found in India, Srilanka, Indonesia, Malaysia and South America. Natural  rubber  may  be  considered  as  a  linear polymer of isoprene (2-methyl-1, 3-butadiene) and is also called as  cis  - 1, 4 - polyisoprene. The   cis -polyisoprene  molecule  consists  of  various  chains  held together    by  weak  van  der  Waals  interactions  and  has  a  coiled structure.  Thus,  it  can  be  stretched  like  a  spring  and  exhibits elastic  properties.  Vulcanisation  of  rubber:   Natural  rubber  becomes  soft  at high  temperature (>335 K) and brittle at low temperatures (<283 K) and shows high water absorption capacity. It is soluble in non- polar solvents and is non-resistant to attack by oxidising agents. To  improve  upon  these  physical  properties,  a  process  of vulcanisation is carried out.

The  growth  of  the  polymer  chain  during  their synthesis is dependent upon the availability of the monomers in the reaction mixture.  Thus, the polymer sample contains chains of varying lengths and hence its molecular mass is always expressed as an average. The molecular mass of polymers can be determined by chemical and  physical  methods. A large number of polymers are quite resistant to the environmental degradation  processes  and  are  thus  responsible  for  the accumulation of polymeric solid waste materials. These solid wastes cause acute environmental problems and remain undegraded for quite a long time.  In view of the general awareness and concern for  the  problems  created    by  the  polymeric  solid  wastes,  certain new  biodegradable  synthetic    polymers  have  been  designed  and developed.  These  polymers  contain    functional  groups  similar  to the functional groups present in biopolymers. Aliphatic  polyesters  are  one  of  the  important  classes  of biodegradable  polymers. Some important examples are given below:  1. Poly   βββββ -hydroxybutyrate  –  co- βββββ -hydroxy  valerate  (PHBV)  It  is  obtained  by  the  copolymerisation  of  3-hydroxybutanoic acid and 3 - hydroxypentanoic acid. PHBV is used in speciality packaging,  orthopaedic  devices  and  in  controlled  release of  drugs.  PHBV  undergoes  bacterial  degradation  in  the environment.  2. Nylon  2–nylon  6  It is an alternating polyamide copolymer of glycine (H 2 N–CH 2 – COOH)    and  amino  caproic  acid  [H 2 N  (CH 2 ) 5   COOH]  and  is biodegradable.

The principles of chemistry have been  used  for  the  benefit  of  mankind.  Think  of cleanliness  —  the  materials  like  soaps,  detergents, household bleaches, tooth pastes, etc. will come to your mind. Look towards the beautiful clothes — immediately chemicals of the synthetic fibres used for making clothes and chemicals giving colours to them will come to your mind. Food materials — again a number of chemicals about which you have learnt in the previous Unit will appear in your mind. Of course, sickness and diseases remind us of medicines — again chemicals. Explosives, fuels,  rocket  propellents,  building  and  electronic materials,  etc.,  are  all  chemicals.  Chemistry  has influenced our life so much that we do not even realise  that we come across chemicals at every moment; that we ourselves are beautiful chemical creations and all our activities are controlled by chemicals. In this Unit, we  shall  learn  the  application  of  Chemistry  in  three important and interesting areas, namely – medicines, food materials and cleansing agents.  Drugs   are  chemicals  of  low  molecular  masses  (~100  –  500u).  These interact with macromolecular targets and produce a biological response. When the biological response is therapeutic and useful, these chemicals are  called   medicines   and    are  used  in  diagnosis,  prevention  and treatment of diseases. Most of the drugs used as medicines are potential poisons,  if  taken  in  doses  higher  than  those  recommended.  Use  of chemicals for therapeutic effect is called  chemotherapy .  1 6 . 11 6 . 1  1 6 . 11 6 . 1 1 6 . 1  Drugs  andDrugs  andDrugs  andDrugs  andDrugs  and theirtheir theirtheirtheir ClassificationClassificationClassificationClassificationClassification 2022-23"

It is useful for doctors because it provides them the whole range of drugs available for the treatment of a particular type of problem. For example, analgesics have pain killing effect, antiseptics kill or arrest the growth of microorganisms.  (b)   On the basis of drug action  It is based on the action of a drug on a particular biochemical process. For example, all antihistamines inhibit the action of the compound, histamine which causes inflammation in the body. There are various ways in which action of histamines can be blocked. You will  learn about this in Section 16.3.2.  (c)   On the basis of chemical structure  It is based on the chemical structure of the drug. Drugs classified in this way  share  common  structural  features  and  often  have  similar pharmacological activity.  For example, sulphonamides have common structural feature, given below.  Structural  features  of  sulphonamides  (d) On the basis of molecular targets  Drugs usually interact with biomolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. These are called target molecules or drug targets. Drugs possessing some common structural features may have the same mechanism of action on targets. The classification based on molecular targets is the most useful classification for medicinal chemists. Macromolecules  of  biological  origin  perform  various  functions  in  the body. For example, proteins which perform the role of biological catalysts in  the  body  are  called   enzymes ,  those  which  are  crucial  to communication system in the body are called  receptors . Carrier proteins carry  polar  molecules  across  the  cell  membrane.  Nucleic  acids  have coded  genetic  information  for  the  cell.  Lipids  and  carbohydrates  are structural parts of the cell membrane. We shall explain the drug-target interaction with the examples of enzymes and receptors.  (a) Catalytic action of enzymes  For understanding the interaction between a drug and an enzyme, it  is  important  to  know  how  do  enzymes  catalyse  the  reaction (Section  5.2.4).  In  their  catalytic  activity,  enzymes  perform  two major functions: (i)   The first function of an enzyme is to hold the substrate for a chemical reaction. Active sites of enzymes hold the substrate molecule in a suitable position, so that it can be attacked by the reagent effectively.  16.1.1 Classification of Drugs  1 6 . 21 6 . 2  1 6 . 2 1 6 . 2 1 6 . 2  Drug-TargetDrug-TargetDrug-TargetDrug-TargetDrug-Target InteractionInteractionInteractionInteractionInteraction  16.2.1 Enzymes as Drug Targets 2022-23"

These can block the binding site of the enzyme and prevent the binding of substrate, or can inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Such drugs are called  enzyme inhibitors.  Drugs inhibit the attachment of substrate on active site of enzymes in two different ways; (i)   Drugs compete with the natural substrate for their attachment on the active sites of enzymes.

Receptors  are  proteins  that  are  crucial  to  body’s  communication process.  Majority  of  these  are  embedded  in  cell  membranes  (Fig. 16.4). Receptor proteins are embedded in the cell membrane in such a way that their small part possessing active site projects out of the surface of the membrane and opens on the outside region of the cell membrane (Fig. 16.4).  16.2.2 Receptors as Drug Targets  Fig.  16.4  Receptor  protein embedded in the cell membrane,  the active site of the receptor opens on the outside region of the  cell.

There  are  a  large  number  of  different  receptors  in  the  body  that interact  with  different  chemical  messengers.  These  receptors  show selectivity for one chemical messenger over the other because their binding sites have different shape, structure and amino acid composition. In the body, message between two neurons and that between neurons to muscles is communicated through certain chemicals. These chemicals, known as  chemical messengers  are received at the binding sites of receptor proteins. To accommodate a messenger, shape of the receptor site changes. This  brings  about  the  transfer  of  message  into  the  cell.  Thus,  chemical messenger gives message to the cell without entering the cell (Fig. 16.5). 2022-23"

There  are  other  types  of  drugs  that  mimic  the  natural messenger  by  switching    on    the  receptor,  these  are  called   agonists . These are useful when there is lack of natural chemical messenger. In this Section, we shall discuss the therapeutic action of a few important classes of drugs. Over production of acid in the stomach causes irritation and pain. In severe  cases,  ulcers  are  developed  in  the  stomach.  Until  1970,  only treatment for acidity was administration of antacids, such as sodium hydrogencarbonate  or  a  mixture  of  aluminium  and  magnesium hydroxide. However, excessive hydrogencarbonate can make the stomach alkaline and trigger the production of even more acid. Metal hydroxides are better alternatives because of being insoluble, these do not increase the pH above neutrality. These treatments control only symptoms, and not the cause. Therefore, with these metal salts, the patients cannot be treated easily. In advanced stages, ulcers become life threatening and its only treatment is removal of the affected part of the stomach. A major breakthrough in the treatment of hyperacidity came through the discovery according  to which a chemical, histamine, stimulates the secretion  of  pepsin  and  hydrochloric  acid  in  the  stomach.  The  drug cimetidine  (Tegamet),  was  designed  to  prevent  the  interaction  of histamine with the receptors present in the stomach wall. This resulted in release of lesser amount of acid.  The importance of the drug was so  much  that  it  remained  the  largest  selling  drug  in  the  world  until another drug, ranitidine (Zantac), was discovered.  1 6 . 31 6 . 3  1 6 . 3 1 6 . 3 1 6 . 3  Therapeutic  Action  ofTherapeutic  Action  ofTherapeutic  Action  ofTherapeutic  Action  ofTherapeutic  Action  of Different  Classes  of  DrugsDifferent  Classes  of  DrugsDifferent  Classes  of  DrugsDifferent  Classes  of  DrugsDifferent  Classes  of  Drugs  16.3.1 Antacids  Histamine is a potent vasodilator. It has various functions. It contracts the smooth muscles in the bronchi and gut and relaxes other muscles, such  as  those  in  the  walls  of  fine  blood  vessels.  Histamine  is  also responsible for the nasal congestion associated with common cold and allergic response to pollen. Synthetic drugs,  brompheniramine (Dimetapp)  and  terfenadine (Seldane),  act as antihistamines. They interfere with the natural action  16.3.2 Antihistamines 2022-23"

Now  the  question  that arises  is,  “Why  do  above mentioned antihistamines not affect the secretion of acid in stomach?” The reason is that antiallergic and antacid drugs work on different receptors. 16.3.3 Neurologically Active Drugs  (a) Tranquilizers  Tranquilizers  and  analgesics  are neurologically active drugs. These affect the message transfer mechanism from nerve to receptor. Tranquilizers  are  a  class  of  chemical  compounds  used  for  the treatment of stress, and mild or even severe mental diseases.  These relieve anxiety, stress, irritability or excitement by inducing a sense of well-being. They form an essential component of sleeping pills. There are various types of tranquilizers. They function by different mechanisms.  For  example,  noradrenaline  is  one  of  the neurotransmitters that plays a role in mood changes. If the level of noradrenaline is low for some reason, then the signal-sending activity becomes low, and the person suffers from depression.  In  such  situations,  antidepressant drugs   are required. These drugs inhibit the enzymes which catalyse the  degradation  of  noradrenaline.  If  the enzyme  is  inhibited,  this  important neurotransmitter  is  slowly  metabolised and  can  activate  its  receptor  for  longer periods of time, thus counteracting the effect of depression. Iproniazid and phenelzine   are two such drugs. Some  tranquilizers namely, chlordiazepoxide and meprobamate, are relatively mild tranquilizers suitable for relieving tension. Equanil is used in controlling depression and hypertension. 2022-23"

These derivatives are called  barbiturates .   Barbiturates are hypnotic,  i.e. , sleep producing agents. Some other substances used as tranquilizers are valium and serotonin.  (b)   Analgesics  Analgesics  reduce or abolish pain without causing impairment of consciousness, mental confusion, incoordination or paralysis or some other disturbances of nervous system. These are classified as follows: (i)   Non-narcotic (non-addictive) analgesics (ii)   Narcotic drugs  (i)   Non-narcotic  (non-addictive)  analgesics:   Aspirin  and paracetamol  belong  to  the  class  of   non-narcotic  analgesics .  Aspirin  is the most familiar example. Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of  chemicals  known  as  prostaglandins  which  stimulate inflammation in the tissue and cause pain. These drugs are effective in relieving skeletal pain such as that due to arthritis. These drugs have many other effects such as reducing fever  (antipyretic)  and preventing platelet coagulation. Because of its anti blood clotting action, aspirin finds use in prevention of heart attacks.  (ii)   Narcotic  analgesics:     Morphine  and  many  of  its  homologues, when  administered  in  medicinal  doses,  relieve  pain  and  produce sleep. In poisonous doses, these produce stupor, coma, convulsions and ultimately death. Morphine narcotics are sometimes referred to as opiates, since they are obtained from the opium poppy. These analgesics are chiefly used for the relief of postoperative pain, cardiac pain and pains of terminal cancer, and in child birth. 2022-23"

                    "content": "Chemistry  Diseases in human beings and animals may be caused by a variety of microorganisms  such  as  bacteria,  virus,  fungi  and  other  pathogens. An antimicrobial tends to destroy/prevent development or inhibit the pathogenic action of microbes such as bacteria (antibacterial drugs), fungi  (antifungal  agents),  virus  (antiviral  agents),  or  other  parasites (antiparasitic drugs) selectively. Antibiotics, antiseptics and disinfectants are antimicrobial drugs.  (a) Antibiotics  Antibiotics are used as drugs to treat infections because of their low toxicity for humans and animals. Initially antibiotics were classified as chemical substances produced by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and molds) that inhibit the growth or even destroy microorganisms. The development of synthetic methods has helped in synthesising some of the  compounds  that  were  originally  discovered  as  products  of microorganisms.  Also,  some  purely  synthetic  compounds  have antibacterial activity, and therefore, definition of antibiotic has been modified. An antibiotic now refers to a substance produced wholly or partly by chemical synthesis, which in low concentrations inhibits the growth or destroys microorganisms by intervening in their metabolic processes. The search for chemicals that would adversely affect invading bacteria but not the host began in the nineteenth century. Paul Ehrlich, a German bacteriologist, conceived this idea. He investigated arsenic based structures in order to produce  less toxic substances for the treatment  of  syphilis.  He  developed  the  medicine,   arsphenamine , known as  salvarsan . Paul Ehrlich got Nobel prize for  Medicine in 1908 for this discovery. It was the first effective treatment discovered for syphilis. Although salvarsan is toxic to human beings, its effect on the bacteria, spirochete, which causes syphilis is much  greater than on human beings. At the same time, Ehrlich was working on azodyes also. He noted that there is similarity in structures of salvarsan and  16.3.4 Antimicrobials  The  structures  of  salvarsan,  prontosil  azodye  and  sulphapyridine  showing  structural similarity. 2022-23"

The –As = As– linkage present in arsphenamine resembles the –N = N – linkage present in azodyes in the sense that arsenic atom is present in place of nitrogen. He also noted tissues getting coloured by  dyes  selectively.  Therefore,  Ehrlich  began  to  search  for  the compounds which resemble in structure to azodyes and selectively bind to bacteria. In 1932, he succeeded in preparing the first effective antibacterial   agent,  prontosil , which resembles in structure to the compound, salvarsan. Soon it was discovered that in the body prontosil is converted to a compound called  sulphanilamide , which is the real active compound. Thus the sulpha drugs were discovered. A large range of sulphonamide analogues was synthesised. One of the most effective is sulphapyridine. Despite  the  success  of  sulfonamides,  the  real  revolution  in antibacterial therapy began with the discovery of Alexander Fleming in  1929,  of  the  antibacterial  properties  of  a   Penicillium   fungus. Isolation and purification of active compound to accumulate sufficient material for clinical trials took thirteen years. Antibiotics have either cidal (killing) effect or a static (inhibitory) effect on microbes. A few examples of the two types of antibiotics are as follows:  Bactericidal   Bacteriostatic  Penicillin   Erythromycin Aminoglycosides   Tetracycline Ofloxacin   Chloramphenicol The range of bacteria or other microorganisms that are affected by a certain antibiotic is expressed as its spectrum of action. Antibiotics which kill or inhibit a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are said to be  broad spectrum antibiotics .   Those effective mainly against Gram-positive  or  Gram-negative  bacteria  are   narrow  spectrum antibiotics .   If effective against a single organism or disease, they are referred to as  limited spectrum  antibiotics. Penicillin G has a narrow spectrum. Ampicillin and Amoxycillin are synthetic modifications of penicillins. These have broad spectrum. It is absolutely essential to test the patients for sensitivity (allergy) to penicillin before it is administered. In India, penicillin is manufactured at the Hindustan Antibiotics in Pimpri and in private sector industry.  Chloramphenicol,  isolated in 1947, is a broad spectrum antibiotic. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hence can be  given  orally  in  case  of  typhoid,  dysentery,  acute  fever,  certain form of urinary infections, meningitis and pneumonia.  Vancomycin  and  ofloxacin  are the other important broad spectrum antibiotics. The antibiotic  dysidazirine  is supposed to be toxic towards certain strains of cancer cells.  H.W. Florey and Alexander Fleming shared the Nobel prize for Medicine in 1945 for their independent contributions to the development of penicillin. 2022-23"

Antiseptics  are applied to the living tissues such as wounds, cuts, ulcers  and  diseased  skin  surfaces.  Examples  are   furacine ,  soframicine,  etc. These are not ingested like antibiotics. Commonly used antiseptic, dettol is a mixture of  chloroxylenol  and  terpineol . Bithionol (the compound is also called bithional) is added to soaps to impart  antiseptic  properties. Iodine is a powerful antiseptic. Its 2-3 per cent solution in alcohol- water  mixture  is  known  as  tincture  of  iodine .  It  is  applied on wounds.  Iodoform  is also used as an antiseptic for wounds. Boric acid in dilute aqueous solution is weak antiseptic for eyes.  Disinfectants   are  applied  to  inanimate  objects  such  as  floors, drainage system, instruments, etc. Same substances can act as an antiseptic as well as disinfectant by varying the concentration. For example, 0.2 per cent  solution of phenol is an antiseptic while its one percent solution is disinfectant. Chlorine in the concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 ppm in aqueous solution and sulphur dioxide in very low concentrations, are disinfectants. Antibiotic revolution has provided long and healthy life to people. The life expectancy has almost doubled. The increased population has caused many social  problems  in  terms  of  food  resources,  environmental  issues, employment, etc. To control these problems, population is required to be controlled.  This  has  lead  to  the  concept  of  family  planning.  Antifertility drugs are of use in this direction. Birth control pills essentially contain a mixture of synthetic estrogen and progesterone derivatives. Both of these compounds  are  hormones.  It  is  known  that  progesterone  suppresses ovulation.  Synthetic  progesterone  derivatives  are  more  potent  than progesterone.   Norethindrone   is  an example  of  synthetic  progesterone derivative  most  widely  used  as antifertility  drug.

Ortho-sulphobenzimide, also called saccharin, is the first popular artificial sweetening agent. It has been used as a sweetening agent ever since it was discovered in 1879. It is about 550 times as sweet as cane sugar. It is excreted from the  body  in  urine  unchanged.  It  appears  to  be  entirely  inert  and harmless when taken.

It is roughly 100 times as sweet as cane sugar. It is methyl ester of dipeptide formed from aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Use of aspartame is limited to cold foods and soft drinks because it is unstable at cooking temperature.  Alitame  is high potency sweetener, although it is more stable than aspartame, the control of sweetness of food is difficult while using it.  Sucralose   is  trichloro  derivative  of  sucrose.  Its  appearance  and taste  are  like  sugar.  It  is  stable  at  cooking  temperature.  It  does  not provide calories. Food preservatives prevent spoilage of food due to prohibiting microbial growth. The most commonly used preservatives include table salt, sugar, vegetable oils and sodium benzoate, C 6 H 5 COONa. Sodium benzoate is used  in  limited  quantities  and  is  metabolised  in  the  body.  Salts  of sorbic acid and propanoic acid are also used as preservatives. These are important and necessary food additives. These help in food preservation  by  retarding  the  action  of  oxygen  on  food.  They  act through  several  chemical  mechanisms.

                    "content": "Chemistry  in  Everyday  Life  Soaps are the detergents used since long. Soaps used for cleaning purpose are sodium or potassium salts of long chain fatty acids, e.g., stearic,  oleic  and  palmitic  acids.  Soaps  containing  sodium  salts  are formed  by  heating  fat  ( i.e. ,  glyceryl  ester  of  fatty  acid)  with  aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. This reaction is known as  saponification . In this reaction, esters of fatty acids are hydrolysed and the soap obtained remains in colloidal form. It is precipitated from the solution by adding sodium chloride. The solution left after removing the soap contains  glycerol,  which  can  be  recovered  by  fractional  distillation. Only sodium and potassium soaps are soluble in water and are used for cleaning purposes. Generally potassium soaps are soft to the skin than  sodium  soaps.  These  can  be  prepared  by  using  potassium hydroxide  solution  in  place  of  sodium  hydroxide.  <strong><strong><strong>Types of</strong></strong></strong> soaps  Basically  all  soaps  are  made  by  boiling  fats  or  oils    with  suitable soluble hydroxide. Variations are made by using different raw materials.  Toilet  soaps   are  prepared  by  using  better  grades  of  fats  and  oils and  care  is  taken  to  remove  excess  alkali.  Colour  and  perfumes  are added to make these more attractive.  Soaps  that  float   in  water  are  made  by  beating  tiny  air  bubbles before their hardening.  Transparent soaps  are made by dissolving the soap in ethanol and then evaporating the excess solvent. In   medicated  soaps,   substances  of  medicinal  value  are  added.  In some soaps, deodorants are added.  Shaving soaps  contain glycerol to prevent rapid drying. A gum called, rosin is added while making them. It  forms  sodium  rosinate  which  lathers  well.   Laundry  soaps   contain fillers like sodium rosinate, sodium silicate, borax and sodium carbonate. Soap chips are made by running a thin sheet of melted soap onto a cool cylinder and scraping off the soaps in small broken pieces.  Soap granules  are dried miniature soap bubbles.  Soap powders  and  scouring soaps  contain some soap, a scouring agent (abrasive) such as powdered pumice or finely divided sand, and builders like sodium carbonate and trisodium phosphate. Builders make the soaps act more rapidly. The cleansing action of soap has been discussed in Unit 5.  Why do soaps not work in hard water?  Hard  water  contains  calcium  and  magnesium  ions.  These  ions  form insoluble calcium and magnesium soaps respectively when sodium or potassium soaps are dissolved in hard water. These insoluble soaps separate as scum in water and are useless as  cleansing  agent.  In  fact  these  are  hinderance  to  good  washing, because the precipitate adheres onto the fibre of the cloth as gummy mass. Hair washed with hard water looks dull because of this sticky precipitate.  Dye  does  not  absorb  evenly  on  cloth  washed  with  soap using hard water, because of this gummy mass. 2022-23"

                    "content": "Chemistry  Synthetic detergents are cleansing agents which have all the properties of soaps, but which actually do not contain any soap.  These can be used both in soft and hard water as they give foam even in hard water. Some of the detergents give foam even in ice cold water. Synthetic  detergents  are  mainly  classified  into  three  categories: (i)  Anionic  detergents  (ii)  Cationic  detergents  and  (iii) Non-ionic detergents  (i)   Anionic  Detergents :   Anionic  detergents  are  sodium  salts  of sulphonated  long  chain  alcohols  or  hydrocarbons.  Alkyl hydrogensulphates  formed  by  treating  long  chain  alcohols  with concentrated  sulphuric  acid  are  neutralised  with  alkali  to  form anionic  detergents.  Similarly  alkyl  benzene  sulphonates  are obtained by neutralising alkyl benzene sulphonic acids with alkali.  16.5.2 Synthetic Detergents  CH (CH ) 3   2   11  H SO 2   4  CH (CH ) 3   2   11   SO   H 3  NaOH(aq)   CH (CH ) 3   2   11   SO   Na 3  +  Dodecylbenzene   Dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid   Sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate  CH (CH ) 3   2   15   N   CH 3  CH 3  CH 3  + Br  Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide  In anionic detergents, the anionic part of the molecule is involved in the cleansing action. Sodium salts of alkylbenzenesulphonates are an important class of anionic detergents. They are mostly used for household work. Anionic detergents are also used in toothpastes.  (ii)   Cationic  Detergents :    Cationic  detergents  are  quarternary ammonium salts of amines with acetates, chlorides or bromides as  anions.  Cationic  part possess  a  long  hydrocarbon chain and a positive charge on nitrogen atom. Hence, these are called  cationic  detergents. C e t y l t r i m e t h y l a m m o n i u m  bromide  is  a  popular  cationic detergent  and  is  used  in  hair conditioners. Cationic detergents have germicidal properties and are expensive, therefore, these are of  limited use.  (iii)   Non-ionic Detergents:   Non-ionic detergents do not contain any ion in their constitution. One such detergent is formed when stearic acid reacts with polyethyleneglycol. Liquid dishwashing detergents are non-ionic type. Mechanism of cleansing action of this type of detergents is the same as that of soaps. These also remove grease and oil by micelle formation. 2022-23"

Main problem that appears in the use of detergents is that if their hydrocarbon chain is highly branched, then bacteria cannot degrade this easily. Slow degradation of detergents leads to their accumulation. Effluents  containing  such  detergents  reach  the  rivers,  ponds,  etc. These persist in water even after sewage treatment and cause foaming in rivers, ponds and streams and their water gets polluted. These days the branching of the hydrocarbon chain is controlled and kept to the minimum. Unbranched chains can be biodegraded more easily and hence pollution is prevented.

A   drug   is  a  chemical  agent,  which affects  human  metabolism  and  provides  cure  from  ailment.  If  taken  in  doses higher  than  recommended,  these  may  have  poisonous  effect.  Use  of  chemicals for  therapeutic  effect  is  called   chemotherapy .  Drugs  usually  interact  with biological  macromolecules  such  as  carbohydrates,  proteins,  lipids  and  nucleic acids.  These  are  called   target  molecules .  Drugs  are  designed  to  interact  with specific  targets  so  that  these  have  the  least  chance  of  affecting  other  targets. This minimises the side effects and localises the action of the drug. Drug chemistry centres  around  arresting  microbes/destroying  microbes,  preventing  the  body from  various  infectious  diseases,  releasing  mental  stress,  etc.  Thus,  drugs  like analgesics,  antibiotics,  antiseptics,  disinfectants,  antacids  and  tranquilizers  are used  for  specific  purpose.  To  check  the  population  explosion,  antifertility  drugs have  also  become  prominent  in  our  life. Food  additives  such  as   preservatives ,   sweetening  agents ,   flavours ,  antioxidants,  edible  colours   and   nutritional  supplements   are  added  to  the food  to  make  it  attractive,  palatable  and  add  nutritive  value.  Preservatives  are added to the food to prevent spoilage due to microbial growth. Artificial sweeteners are  used  by  those  who  need  to  check  the  calorie  intake  or  are  diabetic  and  want to  avoid  taking  sucrose.
